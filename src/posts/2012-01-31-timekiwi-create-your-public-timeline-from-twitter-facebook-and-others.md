Do you know timekiwi ? I've just discovered it because it has been acquired by french company overblog.

timekiwi creates a public timeline from your posts on different services :Â twitter, [instagram](http://instagr.am/), [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [flickr](http://www.flickr.com), [foursquare](http://www.foursquare.com).

It's clean and nicely done.

I've activated mine [here](http://timekiwi.com/lmau).

You can activate yours, it's free and very quick.

Let me know what you think !
