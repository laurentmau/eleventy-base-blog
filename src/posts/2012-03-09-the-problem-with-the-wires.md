IT wires are a pain : Â network wires, power wires.

I fight everyday to have my team installing workstations, network plugs, ... with nice cabling.

It's always difficult, and often we have a big mess under the tables.

This picture has been taken last week during a TV show with french president Nicolas Sarkozy.

What interest me in this picture is what I see in background... Even in the context of a tv show, with the french president, the cables are messy !
