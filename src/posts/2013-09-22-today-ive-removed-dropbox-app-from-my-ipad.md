Today  I've removed Dropbox app from my ipad. 

The reason is very simple : I don't use it anymore since few months. 

I store a lot of files in the cloud, and I was an happy early adopter of Dropbox but as Google drive has improved a lot,  it's now my single place to store files.

I did not plan for this change,  but it happened  because Google Drive makes it easy to share documents and because it can be easily used by several users on the same PC.
