I read [The Big Switch: Rewiring the World from "Edison" to "Google"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0393333949/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=laurentmaum0e-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0393333949)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=laurentmaum0e-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0393333949)
4 years ago.

4 years is an eternity in the tech world, but this book is still worth reading.

The author, Nicholas Carr make a very interesting parallel between electrification and change occurring in the IT world.

I use what I've read there every time I need to explain to someone what cloud computing is about.

Carr also discusses all the impact that this change in IT have on our day to day life.

If you're interested in IT move to the cloud, you should read this book.
