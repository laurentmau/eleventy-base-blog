Thanks to Francisco Saez (@franciscojsaez) , I've an access to a new [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)-like action management website : [facilethings.com](http://facilethings.com/).
I can here your questions coming : "What ? 1 more tool to manage actions ? Why should I try it ?". 
Here're 3 reasons :  * **facilethings.com is really GTD compliant, it's even a very good GTD tutorial.**  
In the different screens you know at which step you're (collect, process,...) and a quick text explain you very clearly what you have to do.  
This is for me what makes this tool special and good to use.  
  


  * **facilethings.com is simple and efficient.**  
The design is very nice : simple, elegant, with an easy access to the different functions.  
  


  * **facilethings.com implement the most important functions ** that are needed for a start.  
For example, the recurring tasks are already there. In many other tools recurring tasks are not implemented, and it's a big miss as we all have recurring tasks !

I'm not sure of the roadmap of the application, for me, it should concentrate on :
  * implementing projects
  * creating mobile applications for android and iphone/ipad.
  * of course, it's very important to keep the fresh and nice design !


If you manage to get an invite and give it a try, and please tell me what you think !
