This morning, an important news has been posted on google official blog : "[Google voice for everyone](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/google-voice-for-everyone.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+blogspot/MKuf+(Official+Google+Blog))".  
Everyone ? Means I can try it from here (France), as I remember it was just available from U.S. before.  
Good news ! I will try it as soon as possible.  
  
But no... "everyone" finally means "everyone in the U.S.".  
  
Google, wake-up!  
  
Even if U.S. is a big country with around 300k persons, we're around 6 800k staying outside U.S. !
