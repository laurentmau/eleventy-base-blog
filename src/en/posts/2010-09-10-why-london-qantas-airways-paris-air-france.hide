I'm just back from Singapore wnere I've spent 4 very efficient business days.  
  
Usually I travel via Paris airport, using Air France plane.  
This time, I decided to change and to try Qantas Airways via London.  
  
The initial reason of this change were :  
- avoid Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and the very bad experience I've everytime with the security controls and the organisation of the airport  
- flight on an Airbus A380  
  
  
Doing this, I had to change my habbits and buy a Qantas Airways ticket i stead of Air France.  
  
My conclusion is that I'm fully happy about this choice !  
  
- in London heathrow, everything went smoothly, no big queue, a good organisation at security checks.  
  
- Qantas airways is a real customer oriented company. You can feel it immediatly on board when the announce is not done by a "chef de cabine" but by the "customer care manager". And this is not bullshit. People on board seems to be really committed to make you happy during the flight.  
  
- The A380 experience is great : more space (few cm... but very important for my long legs), very good and modern Entertainment system.  
  
  
So, even if I'm french, I can tell you that  London + Qantas Airways > Paris + Air France.
