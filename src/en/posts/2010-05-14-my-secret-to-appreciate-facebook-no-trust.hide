They are a lot of discussions these days around how Facebook handle it's user's data privacy.  
I've talked about it in a previous [post](http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2010/05/nightmare-of-facebook-users-data.html).  
  
As far as I'm concerned, **I've absolutely no issue with this**.  
Do you know why ?  
Because **I do not trust Facebook. I do not trust it at all !**  
**  
**  
As a consequence,  all the datas I put there can be public, I've no issue.  
No secrets.  
All my privacy settings are set to share everything, like this, I cannot be disappointed by Facebook if they change their mind.  
  
I think everybody should do like me and this is why :  
  
  1. **Facebook is a very very young company** that has grown very very fast.   
In these conditions, **errors are always possible  
  
**  2. **Facebook is inventing something totally new.**   
Who could imagine this very big social network just 10 years ago ?   
Who can predict what it will be in 5 years ?   
The system is totally new, **the rules need to be written,** so for sure they will change.  
  
  3. **Mark Zuckerberg has never been very keen to commit on user privacy. **  
In fact it's the opposite.   
Facebook commit to provide its users a system to share more and more datas with more and more people, by default, datas are shared.  
**To build a system that is really sure in term of security and privacy it has to be designed for this since the beginning, it has to be part of it's DNA. **This is not the case for Facebook.  
  
Of course not trusting Facebook limit a lot the added value...  
Of course I hope that something new will come in future with less functionalities, but with privacy commitment written in it's DNA.  
Maybe it's [Diaspora ](http://joindiaspora.com/)?
