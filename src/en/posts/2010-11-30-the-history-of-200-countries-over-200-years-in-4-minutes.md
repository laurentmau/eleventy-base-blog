I like gapminder a website by google that shows statistics about demographic and economics for 200 countries, other last 200 years and provides the tools for each user to build his own graphs.


In this video, which is a program from the BBC a scientist uses gapminder to do a real show and comment the evolution of 200 couintries over the las 200 years.

If you like numbers, just dive into it !
