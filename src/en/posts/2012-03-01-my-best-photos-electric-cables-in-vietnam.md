I took this photo in [Hanoi, Vietnam](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=21.0333333333,105.85&spn=0.1,0.1&q=21.0333333333,105.85 (Hanoi)&t=h).

This is a "normal" view of electrical cables in the city !

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the postsÂ [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/wp-admin/edit.php?category_name=photos).
