Here're 2 very good blog posts I've read tonight about cloud computing.  
  * '[IaaS, Hype and Marginal Cost](http://somic.org/2010/03/23/iaas-hype-and-marginal-cost/)' by Dimitriy Samovskiy  * '[The cloud is great. Stop the hype](http://omniti.com/seeds/the-cloud-is-great-stop-the-hype)' by [Theo Schlossnagle](http://lethargy.org/~jesus/).  
These posts are interesting because they go behind the hype and propose a concrete analysis of cloud computing.  
A must read !
