Here's a good video about innovation.
It's a speech by [Scott Berkun](http://www.scottberkun.com/) at [Web 2.0 Expo](http://web20expo.com/) in 2008.
Berkun gives a 10 minutes speech about innovation (post-it, Edison, ...) and finish by this very good idea : the most important question to answer  by innovators to be successfull is


**" What problem are you trying to solve". **


This is especially true for social media !
