This is a very simple photo take from the window of my house.

I like the snow on the trees, it's nice, quiet, and remind me a lot of good memories !

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professionnal of course, but I love them. You can find all the postsÂ [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/wp-admin/edit.php?category_name=photos).
