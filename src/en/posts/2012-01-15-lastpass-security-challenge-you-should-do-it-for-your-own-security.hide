I've already posted about [lastpass](http://lastpass.com), the service I use to secure all my passwords in one single place.

A new tool is now available : the "[security challenge](http://blog.lastpass.com/2012/01/new-years-resolutions-with-lastpass-3.html)".
This tool will screen all your your login/passwords recorded in your lastpass vault and give you statistics



	  * number of duplicate passwords
	  * Â weakness of the passwords
	  * average password length.

I did it.
The first result was obviously terrible : many duplicate passwords.. I basically use 4... and quite weak passwords.

Then you can imagine that changing all these passwords (I've 260 websites secured in lastpass) will be a big pain. This is where lastpass can help again.
Based on the list of all the web sites, it propose you to directly open a new window on this site, then you go to the "change password" option and change it. Of course you still need some time to do it, but it helps a lot !

I love when services like that really gives added value that you did not expect...

Thank you lastpass !
