[Workflowy](http://workflowy.com/) is (another) tool to manage your lists.

"lists" are not just your action lists, it's all kind of lists: a list of ideas when you brainstorm, a list of posts you plan to write, ...

Workflowy does not have any fancy features (like projects, due dates, ...), it's very simple and easy to use.

Workflowy is a web-based application, registration is very easy.

To start, workflowy is just a simple white page where you can enter all your lists. No need to enter "edit" mode or to "save", all your changes are immediately recorded.

What makes workflowy special and very good to use is the very simple and intuitive way to browse your lists.
You can build lists with thousands of items without being lost. Everything is easily structured and organized.

I love it and use it daily.

The video will show you in detail the concept.

If you try it, let me know if you like it!
