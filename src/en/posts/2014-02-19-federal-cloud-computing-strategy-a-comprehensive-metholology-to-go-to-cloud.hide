People often ask me about which methodology I use to drive the migration to the cloud of IT systems.







In fact, the methodology I use is a public one. It has been published in 2011 by [Vivek Kundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra) (former Federal CIO) and is simply called "FEDERAL CLOUD COMPUTING STRATEGY".







This document cannot be found online but I kept it for you, it's here :

It's 32 pages, and it's very easy to read. 







It first explains the expected benefits of the cloud and then proposes a concrete approach to structure the migration. 







A must read!
