On this blog one of the main topic I adress is social media.
When I find good presentations, videos, posts on the topic, I share them here.
I use this material quite often to do presentations or to share with friends.

To make it easy for everybody I've created a specific page that give access to everything from a single [page](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/social-media/), giving some structure.

The page is [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/social-media/).

I hope it will be useful for many of you, if you have ideas, resources to share, feel free to ping me, I'll add them !
