For an organisation, a team to be efficient, proper strategy and thinking is very important. For sure, running a team without a plan, an objective can be very counterproductive : people don't know what they have to do.

Saying this, it's also very important to keep in mind that the biggest risk is to do nothing, because you're scared of not having THE good plan.

Thinking too much sometimes can kill organisations : people spend time discussing about defining basics things, basic rules, and don't move !

The best way to explain this is the "[Centipede's dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede's_dilemma)" :




<blockquote>A spider met a centipede.
"How do you keep all those legs coordinated?" the spider asked.
The centipede replied, "I don't know. I'd never thought about it before."
At this point, the spider ran off, and the centipede tried to give chase, but was unable to because he couldn't make his legs walk properly, and he could never move again.</blockquote>


So, be sure not be affected by the Centipede's Dilemna !
