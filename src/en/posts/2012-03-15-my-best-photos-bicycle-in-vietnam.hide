I took this photo in Hanoi, Vietnam,

The guy tranports hats and baskets on the bicycle.

Bicycles are still very used in Vietnam for day to day transportations.

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the postsÂ [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/category/photos/).
