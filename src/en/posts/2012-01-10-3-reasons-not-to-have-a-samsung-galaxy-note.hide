Yesterday I published a post to explain why you should have a Samsung Galaxy note.  
In this post I'll give you the reasons not to have one (even if I think you should !)  
   
  * **It's too expensive. ** 
The price of the device on amazon.com is $689.99. It's really crasy to buy a so expensive device !  
   
  * **The pen provides no added value. ** 
There's a very good ad where you can see a guy doing creative things using the pen.   
I've the galaxy note since 3 weeks, I've still not use the pen...  
   
  * **It's made of basic plastic. ** 
The back cover is really very poor. Samsung did it to make the device light, but it's really strange to buy a $700 device and to feel afraid to brake it when you need to open it !
