Google now proposes an experimental service to convert text scanned in image format (JPG, PNG or GIF format).  
  
OCR is a very useful functionality on a day to day basis (especially at work) because even if everything is digitalized, we still have printed version, example to contract), and when we need to do a new document, based on a printed one, OCR is needed.  
  
I like this feature which is a good example of google added value.  
  
They have google docs, they develop OCR for google books ( and also for search engine that convert pdf in html), and they just propose it as a simple service for us.  
  
To try it, it's here http://googlecodesamples.com/docs/php/ocr.php
