To make the blog more interactive I've finally activated the comments.

I had to spend some time as the [theme](http://zenhabits.net/theme/) I use (done by Leo Babauta) does not support them. I had to change manually the source code.

I use [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com/) system because I like blogs that use it. It offers a good level of functionality : authentication, notifications, threads.

Feel free to leave your comments and your ideas !
