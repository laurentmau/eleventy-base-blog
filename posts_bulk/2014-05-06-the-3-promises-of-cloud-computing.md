People often ask me what is cloud computing added-value.
My answer is :


####  1- Lower cost of ownership


Going to the cloud means the big modification, infrastructure sharing, same software for all. This will necessarily bring lower cost of ownership.


#### 2- Better functionalities.


Cloud based applications (Software as a service) are new software. They use last available technologies and implement new functional concepts. The major improvement is about collaboration. Because ‘file’ as we knew it for ever does not exist anymore, people can collaborate easily in a totally new way.


#### 3- Better agility and flexibility


With cloud infrastructure can be started up or stopped on demand, applications do not need to be installed. They just need to be used. This brings a totally new dimension in term of agility and flexibility.
