I read all posts written by [Tac Anderson](http://www.tacanderson.com) on his blog [newcommbiz](http://www.newcommbiz.com/).

Last wednesday Tac published a very interesting post about his [new social workflow](http://www.newcommbiz.com/my-social-media-workflow/).

This post is very good because it's very clear, concrete and explains everything about Tac's organisation on social medias ( to publish posts on his blogs, Twitter, facebook, to share good links, ...).

I let you read it for further details.

Based on this, I've improved and updated my own system.

The main changes are :



	  1. **I've created a new blog on tumblr : [lmaulight](http://lmaulight.tumblr.com/).**
I'll post on this blog all the links I share : my own blog posts and other good posts I find.
I'll also post photos I take (not sure what I'll do with [path](https://path.com/)).
If you want to follow everything about me , just follow it !
	  2. **I've also decided to use [diigo](http://www.diigo.com/user/laurentmaumet).**
[Diigo](http://www.diigo.com) seems to be more than a bookmarking tool, but for a start I'll use it just for this purpose : it will collect all the good links I find and help me to retrieve them.
Later I'll see if I can do more with it.






To implement this, I use[ ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com) and [buffer ](http://bufferapp.com/dashboard)as recommended by Tac.







I've not yet implemented a facebook page. I'm thinking about it, but not decided yet...







I hope to see you on my blogs soon !




What do you thonk about it ? Any idea ? Any comment ?
