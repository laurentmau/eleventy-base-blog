I spend around 1 hour per day browsing hundreds of feeds.

Since many years, I'm a big user of [Google reader](http://www.google.com/reader).





Recently I've started to use [feedly](http://www.feedly.com), based on an advice from [Tac Anderson.](https://twitter.com/#!/tacanderson)





The switch is now definitive, I'll not come back to Google reader (at least for few weeks...).





Here're   6 good reasons for you to do the same :  








     1. [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com) is very nice. The design is just fantastic, ad the reading experience very nice (on all platorms)
     2. Feedly is available on pc, android, iOs. Today I use it in Chrome on my lpatop, on my iPad and on my Galaxy Note.
     3. Feedly implements very good sharing features, easy to use.
     4. Feedly proposes a chrome plugin "feedly mini" that gives me access to the sharing features when I'm reading a site
     5. Going from Google reader to feedly is very easy to set-up as feedly synchronize with google reader feeds in 1 click
     6. Feedly keeps synchronised with google reader (subscriptions, posts read, ...) so it's very easy to go back




  

I hope I've convinced you to give it a try!





Let me know.
