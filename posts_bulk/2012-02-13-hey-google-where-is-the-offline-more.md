2 years ago I wrote a post about the need of offline mode for google services (google documents and gmail).
Offline mode is really a missing feature especially Â for people who travel.

2 years ago, google used to use a plugin "google gear" to implement a minimal offline mode : mails were accessible and documents were in read-only mode.

Where are we 2 years later ?

Nowhere.

Google [gears](http://gears.google.com/) has disappeared.

For gmail an application is available in the chrome webstore, but it's not really good as it's not consistent with the normal way to access gmail.

Google promised to implement offline using html5, but it's still not available.

If anyone knows about the roadmap, let me know !
