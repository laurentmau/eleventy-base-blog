Since 1 year now I use [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) principles to manage my emails and achieve the ultimate goal :** inbox 0**.

I've described this [in a previous postÂ ](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-method-to-keep-my-inbox-empty/).
The idea is quite simple, based on 5 folders :

**0 - Inbox**: where all emails come when I receive them
**1 - Action**: email for which an action from me is needed
**1 - Read / Review**: emails that with stuff I need to read / review<
**2 - Waiting for **: emails for which I'm waiting an action from someone else
**3 - Done**: emails processed, keeped for archive.

For more detail on how I use these folders, you can refer to the[ initial post.](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-method-to-keep-my-inbox-empty/)

The most important thing is to be able to empty the inbox and file emails in the proper folder in a very efficient way, as fast as possible.
To make it really very easy for me I've done some customisations of my outlook client to implement 4 customs buttons.

When I open an email, the 4 buttons are accessible.

Their function is very simple :



	  * "Done" files the mail in the "3- Done" folder
	  * "Action" files the email in the "1-Action folder"
	  * "Read" files the email in the "1- Read / Review folder"
	  * "Waiting for" files the email in the "2- Waiting for email"

Here's a quick guide to implement these buttons in your outlook.

First, you need to create 4 macros : MoveDone(), MoveAction(), MoveRead(), MoveWaitingFor().
Here's the source code template. Just use it 4 times, replacing the name and the macro and the name of the folder.

	  * Just open an existing email
	  * Right click in the toolbar then "Customize"
	  * In the popup, chosse "Macro". You should see the 4 macros you have created.
	  * Then drag and drop macro 1 by 1 from the pop up to the email tool bar.
	  * Here're the 4 buttons !

Now, just go to your full inbox, open the first email, and start to clean !
