I took this photo in the funicular railway that brings passengers up to Hong Kong's Victoria peak.

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the postsÂ [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/category/photos/).
