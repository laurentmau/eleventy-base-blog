95% of presentations are boring.
Everybody use PowerPoint few people know how to use it.

I'm always trying to do better presentations to make them less boring, more efficient.
This very good series of presentations written by [Eduardo S. de la Fuente](http://www.slideshare.net/eduardo.delafuente)Â is full of tips, ideas to make it happen.

If you do presentations, you should read this carefully.

In this first one, you'll learn :






	  * some statistics ("95% of powerpoint presentations suck" Guy Kawasaky).
	  * some common mistakes (too many bullet points...)
	  * that YOU can change this and improve !

Relax, breath and enjoy !
Do not miss the video on slide 21 !
