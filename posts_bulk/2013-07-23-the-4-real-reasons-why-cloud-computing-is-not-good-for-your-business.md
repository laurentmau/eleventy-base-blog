The IT world is in mutation. This is now sure. Legacy IT is going to the cloud.

Around me, I see people that don't really believe it or are reluctant, so here're the 4 reasons that can explain why cloud computing is not good for your business :



 	  1. because your IT team does not understand it
 	  2. because you think it's safer to keep your money under your bed instead of putting it in a Bank
 	  3. because  you are afraid of  change and love status quo, and you're convinced that it was better in the old days
 	  4. because you produce your own electricity and don't want to rely on centralized power plants









If none of these are true for you... believe me, you should proceed!
