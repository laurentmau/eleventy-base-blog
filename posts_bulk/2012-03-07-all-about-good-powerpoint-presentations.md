One of my favorite topics is about how to improve bad (powerpoint) presentations.
At work we spend a lot of time in meetings where the speaker uses powerpoint presentation to support his speach.
Powerpoint is also used for sales meeting, to introduce products.

These presentations are too often boring : too long, not enough structured, messy, too complicated.

Powerpoint ios not a bad tool. It's even a good one : a lot of functionalities, easy to use.
In fact t becomes a problem because it makes it too easy to produce slides.

On this blog I post time to time about good ressources on the topic to help us to improve.

To make it more efficient I've created a specific page where all these resources are listed :
