As I've explained in a previous [I'm a premium spotify user](http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2009/11/why-im-happy-premium-spotify-user.html) since last november.  
  
I use spotify daily at home on my desktop, on my laptop and traveling, on iPhone.  
  
What I prefer in spotify is :  
  
  * the access to a huge catalog of music  * a good iphone application with a very important offline mode  
On my post in november, I wrote :

<blockquote>Of course, now, I hope that spotify will improve the experience with new functionnalities in the application (better playlist management) and social features</blockquote>

"  
  
  
Today spotify released a new version of its application, and ... the new version brings social features and better library management !  
  
With this new version, it's now possible to share playlists using facebook (when spotify is launched, it asks you login/password to connect to your facebook account).  
  
The other new important feature is that the music files on your computer are accessible throw spotify UI.  
  
I already love it !  
  
(normally, the update comes automatically, if it does not, you can just go to the spotify website and download it).  
  
See you on spotify.
