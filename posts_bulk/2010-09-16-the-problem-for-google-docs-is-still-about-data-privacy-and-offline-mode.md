9 months ago I wrote [a post](http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2010/01/offline-mode-and-security-2-missing.html) to explain that the 2 big challenges for Google to deploy widely google apps in companies was about data privacy and offline mode.



Where are we today ?

**For offline mode**, the situation is worse than before as google has desactivated it....

**For data privacy**, the problem is still there and a news today shows that it's real and that google absolutly need to find a solution : [a google engineer has been fired for accessing user data](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/google-engineer-fired-security/).

The reaction of Google was of course to fire the guy, which seems normal, but this obviously raise questions to all users, CIOs that will think twice before giving all their datas to Google.
