The [Breathing Earth Simulation](http://www.breathingearth.net/) is a  very nice real-time simulation that display on a map the CO2 emissions, birth and death rates, by country.  
  
You can see the earth breathing.  
  
The counter in the bottom right corner is impressive : it shows the cumulative number of death and born people sicnce you open the page.  
  
When you go to every country, you can have the detail statisitcs for this country.  
  
The source data seems to be reliable : [CIA World Factbook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook) and [United Nations Statistics Division](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Statistics_Division).  
  
A very nice way to present and help people to "feel" key numbers.
