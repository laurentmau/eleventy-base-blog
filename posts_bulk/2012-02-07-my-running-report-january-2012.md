With this post I start a new series in which I'll report my running activity.

I started to run seriously in June 2010, 18 months ago.

My objective is to be able to run a marathon. This should happen this year in october in Amsterdam (to be confirmed).

My short term objective is to run the Annecy half-Marathon on apritl 15th.

I ran this race in 2011 in 2:07.

The objective for this year is to go below 2 hours.

This will be a big challenge as my agenda is really full in the next months.

In January I ran 39 km. This is quite low, last year I ran 83.

My motivation was not very high, and I did not manage to find the motivation to wake-up at 5:30 am to run in the cold night.

The race is now in 10 weeks, so it's time to start to run seriously 3 times per week.
