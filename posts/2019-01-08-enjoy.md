My word for 2019 will be &#8220;Enjoy&#8221;

#### I started with this &#8220;word of the year&#8221; idea 3 years ago. 

This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj" target="_blank">Benoit Curdy</a>.



In 2016, my word of the year was&nbsp; &#8220;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://laurentmaumet.com/focus/" target="_blank">Focus</a>&#8220;, which, for me, functioned as a reminder to spend more time on fewer things, avoid multitasking, be more present. 

The next year I chose &#8220;[Learn](http://laurentmaumet.com/learn)&#8221; and spent more time on learning new <g class="gr_ gr\_21 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="21" data-gr-id="21">things related</g> to digital like coding, big data, machine learning but also <g class="gr_ gr\_81 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="81" data-gr-id="81">lern</g> things related <g class="gr_ gr\_113 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="113" data-gr-id="113">to the</g> personal organization, to geopolitics, to history.

Finally, for 2018, I chose &#8220;[Read](http://laurentmaumet.com/read/)&#8221; with a target of 24 books to be read during the year (I finished at [17](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10834395)), doing some posts about the books ([I did it for 2](http://laurentmaumet.com/books/)).

#### For this year, my word will simply be &#8220;Enjoy&#8221;.

I&#8217;ll try as much as I can to enjoy the moment, take time to appreciate a simple meal with my family, time to enjoy visiting a new city, time to enjoy running, looking at nature. To put it <g class="gr_ gr\_16 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">simple</g>, enjoy more all small things that make <g class="gr_ gr\_31 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="31" data-gr-id="31">my life</g>.

For this, I&#8217;ll have to calm down, chill out, and also sometime take a step back from my busy schedule. I&#8217;ll also have to improve the way I deal with notifications coming from all devices (more on that on a post coming). 

I also plan to enjoy more at work. 

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love my job. I&#8217;m really passionate about it, tt&#8217;s full of excitement, stimulations, great responsibilities, nice colleagues, &#8230; but for this year I want to take time to realize how lucky I&#8217;m to hold such a position, to take time to celebrate our great results take time to really enjoy it.

&#8220;Enjoy&#8221; means also being optimistic. People keep telling me I&#8217;m not so bad at it, often I&#8217;m the guy that sees the &#8220;half-full&#8221; glass of water and this why the headline of my blog is &#8220;Welcome, Smile, Life is good !&#8221;. 

Being optimistic is a strong engine for me and I&#8217;m convinced it helps to be to be stronger. Recently I&#8217;ve realized I&#8217;m sometimes less optimistic as I used to be especially in some stressful or boring situations. 

I&#8217;ll try to keep the positive view during this year!

### I wish you a very good year. Enjoy !
