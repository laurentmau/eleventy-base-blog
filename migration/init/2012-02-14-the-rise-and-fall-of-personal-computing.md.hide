Changes are occuring faster and faster in tech world.

I love this chart from [asymco.com](http://www.asymco.com/), because it shows in 1 page this acceleration.

The Y scale is a logarithmic scale and even like this we can see that Android and iPad growth is just crasy compare to the whole history.

It shows also very well ho ;obile devices are boo;ing and are now more important than traditionnal personnal computing devices (PC, Mac).

Where will it stop ?
