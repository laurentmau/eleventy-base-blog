In a post last October I asked my self if [I should buy a kindle](http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2009/10/will-i-get-kindle-for-christmas.html) for Christmas.  
  
Finally, I did not and now I'm sure it was a good decision.  
I'll never buy a kindle because I'll buy an [iPad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad), and I'll use the kindle application to access [amazon books](http://amazon.com/).  
  
I've already tried the kindle application for [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone).  
I've read a first real book on it and I was very impressed of the quality of the reading experience even on a very small screen : good contrast, very easy to read (even in bad luminosity conditions).  
  
Having it on an Ipad (which is basically a big Iphone) will be just perfect for me.  
  
I've just found an[ article in mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/03/06/ipad-consumer-behavior/), where you'll see that other people think like me.  
  
So finally, Amazon will not sell a lot of kindle, but will sell a lot of electronic books, thanks to the kindle application.
