I wrote a post "[My music experience](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-music-experience/)" in april this year, 6 motnhs ago.  
The purpose of this post was to give my personnal experience about music, from the 80s to these days.

My conclusion was that [spotify ](http://www.spotify.com/)would be a perfect system for me, with few enancements :

<blockquote>to be able to "download" the music I like on some mp3 devices to be able to listen to them not connected to the internet.
> 
> </blockquote>

<blockquote>to have a better management of my library (not just simple playlist).
> 
> </blockquote>

<blockquote>to imporve the social part of it : having my friend using it and sharing new songs / artists we discover
> 
> </blockquote>

So what is the situation today ?  
Very simple, I'm now a premium spotify user, I pay 10â‚¬/month for that.  
I use spotify everyday to listen music : on my laptop when I work and I need to concentrate, in my car or at home on my stereo system, using the iphone.  
Why did I subscribe to the premuim ? 3 reasons :  
  1. To get rid of the advertisment of the free version : In the free version, the advertisment message comes every 10/15 minutes, with the same message ! It's quite boring !  2. To use the Iphone application :  The Iphone application is great. The level of functionnalities is the same as the desktop version.  3. The most important feature is the "offline mode".  In this mode, the applications download the music when you're connected to wifi, and after you can listen to it even if the Iphone is not connected to a network

I've around 800 cds that I've paid at an average price of 15 Euros so a total of 1 200 Euros.  
This is equivalent to 10 years of spotify's premium subscription !

So today I'm a happy spotify premium user, I don't use anymore [itunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) or [windows mediaplayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player), and I do not plan to buy any new CD or buy music online.

Of course, now, I hope that spotify will improve the experience with new functionnalities in the application (better playlist management) and social features.
