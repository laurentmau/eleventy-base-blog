I took this photo in Pelleautier Lake in French Alps.

It was a sunny day (like very often in the area).

The moutain in background is the "Pic de Bure".

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professionnal of course, but I love them.
