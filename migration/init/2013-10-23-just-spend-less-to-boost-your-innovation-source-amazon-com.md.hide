This slide describe the 3 pillars of Amazon culture. Of course, Amazon is Customer centric. Of course Amazon is a company that innovate a lot. What is very interesting is that [Jeff Bezos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) (Amazon's CEO) explains that **frugality** (spending less) is a boost for innovation. I like this concept and strongly believe he is right.
