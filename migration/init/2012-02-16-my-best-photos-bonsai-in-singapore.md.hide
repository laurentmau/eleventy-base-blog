I love bonsai trees.

I took this photo in Singapore's Chinese Garden.

In this place there're the best bonsais I've ever seen.

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the postsÂ [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/wp-admin/edit.php?category_name=photos).
