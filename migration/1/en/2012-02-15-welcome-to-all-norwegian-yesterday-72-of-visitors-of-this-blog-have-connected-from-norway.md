Yesterday something strange happened.

72% of visitors of this blog have connected from Norway.

On a normal day, main connected countries are France and US.

I'm not sure what happened.


All this visitors came to see an old post "[5 iconic imagesâ€¦ in 3D](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/5-iconic-images-in-3d/)" about which I sent a tweet yesterday morning

Is it because of the topic ?

Is it because by luck this tweet has been put on a homepage?

Was it just a robot ?

If you have an idea, or if you connect from Norway, feel free to leave me a comment here !
