Today, [Alexander Vinokourov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Vinokourov) won the cycling race "[Liege-Bastogne-Liege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge)".  
Is it really important ? Maybe not, except for cycling fans like me...  
  
What interests me here is that the race ended at 14:52, and wikipedia started to be updated only 3 minutes later !

I'm currently reading the book "[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594488843/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1272208951&sr=1-1)" by [Daniel H. Pink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink).  
  
This book discuss about motivation, and the first example taken is to compare the 2 encyclopedias [Encarta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta) from Microsoft and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia).  
One done by the big Microsoft with a lot of money, and the other by a lot of anonymous volunteers.  
Of course, you know the result, the team of highly motivated people built the very complete Wipidedia, and Encarta... does not exist anymore.  
  
Today one more time, a cycling fan took some time to update Wikipedia with the result of the race, and Wikipedia is immediately up-to-date.
