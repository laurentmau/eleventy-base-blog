I took this photo in Tuk-tuk, [Lake Toba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Toba), on [Sumatra island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra) in [Indonesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia).

It's was a rainy evening, by the lake.
Sunset helps to do nice photo with beautifull colors.

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the posts [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/category/photos/).
