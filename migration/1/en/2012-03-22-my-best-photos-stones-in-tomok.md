I took this photo in Tomok, [Lake Toba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Toba), on Sumatra island in [Indonesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia).

Lake Toba is a very special place in Indonesia.

It's the place of [Batak people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak_%28Indonesia%29).
Batak used to practise cannibalism rituals until late 19th century. These stones were part of the ritual place.

This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professional of course, but I love them. You can find all the posts [here](http://laurentmaumet.com/english/category/photos/).
