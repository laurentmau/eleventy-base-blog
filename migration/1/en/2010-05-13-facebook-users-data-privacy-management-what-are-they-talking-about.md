These days we see a lot of discussion around the way [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) (does not) take care of it's user's data privacy.  


Here're the 2 best sources I've found that describe the "problem".  
In fact I don't think there's a problem, I'll explain why in a coming post, but it's interesting to look at these 2 articles to understand what people are talking about.  
  


In this [diagram ](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html?src=tptw)The [New York times](http://www.newyorktimes.com/) give a view on the 50 settings with more than 170 options that are available to manage privacy on facebook.

In this series of images [Matt McKeon](http://www.mattmckeon.com/about.html) shows the evolution of privacy default settings over the years (from 2005 to now).

It's amazing to see how user's data are more and more public by default everyday...
