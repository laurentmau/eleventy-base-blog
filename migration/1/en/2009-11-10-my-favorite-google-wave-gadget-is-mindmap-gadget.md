I use [Mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) on a day to day basis when I need to structure a topic, especially in brainstorming phase.

For this, I use [freemind ](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/)which an open source dekstop application.

I've discovered last week a gadget for Google [wave](http://wave.google.com/) that allow you to build a mind map within a wave.

Very powerful to work remotely.

Of course this first version has limited functionalities, but it's ok to start to use it.

All the informations are on "[Bruce's blog](http://www.brucecooper.net/2009/11/mind-map-gadget-for-google-wave.html)"
