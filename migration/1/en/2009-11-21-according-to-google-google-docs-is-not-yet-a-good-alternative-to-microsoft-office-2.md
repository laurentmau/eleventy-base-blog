The battle between google and microsoft is in progress, with a big battle Microsoft office / Google documents.

 

Every day news come about new companies switching from Microsoft office to google doc.

 

 

 

Last week, Dave Girouard gave an interview to [ZDnet Asia](http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,62059318,00.htm?tag=mncol;txt).

 

Dave Girouard is an important guy in google (he's one of the company's four presidents including founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin), so his words are important.

 

 

And what he said in this interview was a big surprise for me.

 

To make it short, he explained** that google documents is not the good solution for enterprise yet, it will be in 1 year !**

 

 

His exact words are :

 

 

<blockquote>We wouldn't ask people to get rid of Microsoft Office and use Google Docs because it is not mature yet</blockquote>

 

 

 

<blockquote>he expects Google's online document application, Google Docs, to reach a "point of capability" next year that will serve the "vast majority's needs".</blockquote>

 

 

 

Of course, using both Google documents (for personal use) and Microsoft office tools (for business), I know the differences that exist between them, and that google is still behind, but I did not expect a google guy to admit it.

 

 

Now the question is : is 1 year the good timing to expect Google documents to catch Microsoft office in term of capabilities ... or will it take more than that ?
