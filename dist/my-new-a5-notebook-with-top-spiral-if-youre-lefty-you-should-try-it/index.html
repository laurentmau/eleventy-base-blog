<p>I think I’ve found the good notebook for me, it’s a simple A5 Note pad with top spiral .</p>
<p>Top spiral is important because :</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easy to turn pages</li>
<li>it makes it easy to tear a page</li>
<li>it makes it easy for me to write, as I’m a lefty (yes, for lefty people, writing in a “normal” notebook is difficult, with a  a top spiral I can write without pressing my wrists into the spiral )</li>
</ul>
<p>I use it in a very simple way : 1 page = 1 topic.</p>
<p>Every meeting, every discussion, every topic I use a new black page, starting by writing in the right top corner the date and the topic.</p>
<p>I do not hesitated to tear pages if what I wrote is not valuable or if I’ve copied it in my electronic system because it was valuable.</p>
<p>And you, what do you use ?</p>
