<p>Finally, they did it.</p>
<p>I was waiting for it since months, when it had been annouced with previous version of Picasa : google implemented name tag for faces in Picasa.</p>
<p>Why is it so important for me ? Because now as google says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<br>
I can organize your photos based on what matters most: the people in them<br>
“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, picasa (desktop) scan your photo and find faces.<br>
then you can tag them (like on facebook for example).</p>
<p>The algorithm seems to be efficient (of course, between kids… they’re some mistakes) and the functions to tag well implemented (photo / photo, bulk update, suggestions, …).</p>
<p>I’m using it since yesterday to tag my thousands of photos. I’m very happy with it.</p>
