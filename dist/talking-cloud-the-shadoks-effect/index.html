  As a CIO one of the biggest challenges I face in my journey to cloud computing  (using SaaS or real public IaaS) is the IT ecosystem resistance.

  Going to the cloud is for them a big challenge because it will change completely their job (no more licenses to sell, no more big integration projects).
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  It will impact their business model deeply: fully flexible costs based on usage, no more upgrades, no more  &#8216;maintenance&#8217;  fees.

  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Shadoks">Shadoks</a> used to say <strong>&#8216;Why do it easy when you can do it the hard way?&#8217;</strong>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  Many consultants become Shadoks when they talk about cloud computing.

  We start from a very simple concept: a multi-tenant application accessible by a single browser and shared by all users and we come to discuss very complicated stuff like &#8216;private cloud&#8217;, &#8216;PaaS&#8217;, &#8216;IaaS&#8217;,  &#8216;hybrid&#8217;, &#8216;public&#8217;, &#8230;
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  All this is explained in complicated charts, with different words.
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  The problem of that is we often lose the initial objective and finally just discuss implementing some private cloud (which is not the cloud !)
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
  I&#8217;m more than ever convinced that the IT world is in strong mutation and that cloud will change everything.
</div>
<div>
  Players need to adapt or disappear.
</div>
<div>
  Cloud is simple and easy to go, don&#8217;t make it complicated.
