<p>As I’ve explained in a <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/" title="My experience with ZTD : let’s start">previous post</a>, I’ve decided to use <a class="zem_slink" title="Zen To Done" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" rel="homepage">Zen To Done</a> productivity methodology by Leo Babauta.</p>
<p>This is the feedback after 2 weeks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the first habit I’ve decided to implement is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.</p>
<p>During week #1, the success rate has been <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/" title="week 1">52 % (11/21)</a></p>
<p>Here’re the results of week #2 :</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>****3 MITs for the week : ****Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES,  How many did I achieve : 1/3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Day 1 (January 23th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :3/3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Day 2  (January 24th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Day 3 (January 25th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES (4), How many did I achieve : 2/4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Day 4 (January 26th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Day 5 (January27th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : NO , How many did I achieve : 0/3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total : I’ve defined the MITs 4 times instead of 5, I’ve achieved  9/19.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>** What are  my conclusions ?**</p>
<ul>
<li>9/19 is a poor result. It’s even worse than last week (11/21). I’ve clearly over committed to myself during that week. Like last week there’s 1 specific MIT that I’ve pushed from day 1 to day 5  that made me loose 5  points.</li>
<li>I did not defined the MITs on friday as my work day started at 6am.</li>
<li>Even if the numbers are quite bad, I’m happy with this week. It was a VERY busy week, and defining 3 MITs everyday really helped me to keep control. I’m still happy with my new way to use todo system nirvanahq (I’ve removed all project, and used 1 simple list)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the new coming week, my objective is to continue the implementation of this new habit, with a better result !</strong></p>
