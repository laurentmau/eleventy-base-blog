<p>After my big failure last december a<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/one-day-ill-be-a-marathoner-today-i-failed-but-i-did-not-give-up/" title="One day I’ll be a marathoner : today I failed, but I did not give up !">t Singapore half maratho</a>n, I’m now training again to run another half-marathon in Annecy on April 15th.</p>
<p><a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-running-report-january-2012/" title="My running report : January 2012">January</a> has been a recovery month, with not so high motivation, and I ran 5 times and 39km.<br>
February was better. I ran 9 times for a total of 74 km.<br>
It’s better compared to last month, but still not enough.</p>
<p>My objective is to run 3 times per week which is at least12 times per month…</p>
<p>I really appreciated running this month.</p>
<p>I did one of my best run ever on the snow. It has been a fantastic experience, alone in the woods, listening to good music.</p>
<p>March will be very important to come in good shape and by ready on april 15 th,.</p>
<p>It should be ok, because high motivation is back, and the weather is really better now with better temperatures.</p>
