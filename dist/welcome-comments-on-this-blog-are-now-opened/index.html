<p>I had to spend some time as the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/theme/" title="theme">theme</a> I use (done by Leo Babauta) does not support them. I had to change manually the source code.</p>
<p>I use <a class="zem_slink" title="DISQUS" href="http://www.disqus.com/" rel="homepage">Disqus</a> system because I like blogs that use it. It offers a good level of functionality : authentication, notifications, threads.</p>
<p>Feel free to leave your comments and your ideas !</p>
