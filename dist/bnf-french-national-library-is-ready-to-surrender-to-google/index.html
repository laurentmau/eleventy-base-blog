<p>For years, and especially when <a rel="wikipedia" title="Jean-Noël Jeanneney" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-No%C3%ABl_Jeanneney" class="zem_slink">Jean-Noël Jeanneney</a> was in charge of the BNF (2002-2007), BNF has refused to discussed with google to scan it’s books.</p>
<p>Jeanneney wrote a book about it : “Google and the myth of Universal knowledge : a view from Europe”.<br>
The argument is that google is a US private company so :</p>
<ul>
<li>they will make money with it, wich is against french idea of universal access to books</li>
<li>they will not scan everything, but they will make choices, and the criteria will be an US angle</li>
</ul>
<p>At one point of time French people wanted to launch an initiative “against” Google initiative to scan books <a href="http://gallica.bnf.fr/">Gallica</a>.</p>
<p>Today we learn that some discussions are ongoing between <a href="http://passouline.blog.lemonde.fr/2009/08/25/la-colere-de-jeanneney-contre-laccord-google-bnf/comment-page-1/#comments">Google and the BNF</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons are easy : governments do not give money to do Gallica, and google proposes to do it for free.</p>
<p>This is a very important news, it should make a lot of noise …</p>
