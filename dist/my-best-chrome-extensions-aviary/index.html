<p>I use it when I have simple images to edit.</p>
<p>I like it because it’s easy, simple, free, and in the cloud, so I’ve access to all my creation whatever device I use.</p>
<p>The aviary chrome extension is very basic, with a simple click it capture the current page and opens aviary for further editing.</p>
<p>If you have to do such action, I highly recommend you to install it.</p>
<p>I use it a lot.</p>
<p>If you want to try it, just follow <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ncgcgghbabbopfcpgcjpfffdgnbadegf" title="aviary">the link</a>.</p>
