The principle is to record all your passwords in a simple place and remember only one which is your lastpass password, like the key of your safe.</p>
<p>I use the service since few years now to secure all my passwords for all the services I use (I’ve more than 200 sites secured).<br>
Lastpass proposes a chrome extension I use everyday when I’m connected : at home, at work.</p>
<p>The main reason I use it is because of the chrome extension : it makes the access to the service simple and easy.</p>
<p>This simple extension is the access point to the lastpass service and gives access to your “lastpass vault” where all your passwords are secured.</p>
<p>The extension is also screening the pages you’re browsing and if necessary proposes you to automatically fill login / password. It’s really very well done.</p>
