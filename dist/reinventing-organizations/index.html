<p>The main points I’d like to highlight are :<br>
– the explanation on why implementing “Lean” can be a problem if the organization is not at a good level.<br>
– the idea that the world is not black &amp; white and that all types of organizations can be useful based on company history, challenges, and objectives.</p>
