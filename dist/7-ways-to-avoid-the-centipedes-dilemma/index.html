In a <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/is-your-team-affected-by-the-centipedes-dilemna/" title="Is your team  affected by the “Centipede’s Dilemna” ?">previous post</a> I’ve described the “Centipede’s dilemma” that may affect your team.</p>
<p>Here’re some rules to avoid this Centiped’s dilemma and make your team as efficient as possible :</p>
<ol>
<li>be clear on the objective : if team members know what they have to achieve, they will not loose time in discussions.</li>
<li>be as clear as possible on the plan : what are the milestones, the deliverables.</li>
<li>be clear that the team has to success, not to explain the failure.</li>
<li>on a project reuse standard templates from previous projects (for minutes of meetings, …) : we need to reuse,  reuse, resue… No creativity is needed for templates, templates will help people to focus on the essential.</li>
<li>set a standard who / what / when template for action lists : people should not spend days to put in place action lists</li>
<li>define proper governance model with at least 2 level (operational / steering) and be sure to make it work as soon as possible.</li>
<li>be sure to involve experienced team members. They will detect “centipede dilemma” effect and react immediately to propose ways to proceed.</li>
</ol>
