<h1>Will I get a Kindle for Christmas ?</h1>



<hr>
<time class="postlist-date" datetime="Invalid DateTime">Invalid DateTime</time>

<hr>

<p>This morning, I connected to my favorite <a href="http://amazon.com/">amazon.fr</a> (yes, I'm in France) to order a book.</p>
<p>And... fantastic news... on the home page, I can read &quot;<strong>The new kindle is now available for ordering</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a news I'm waiting for months.</p>
<p>The things I'm waiting from a kindle are :</p>
<pre><code>  * be able to buy a new book and have it immediatly (yes, I'm quite impatient sometimes...)


  * have just 1 thing to bring in which I've all my books. I often read few books at the same time...


  * have my favorite newspaper directly at home. I love reading newspaper, but it's sometimes boring to go and buy them (especially in winter, cold weather...)
</code></pre>
<p>So this news made me very happy !
I plan to buy a kindle since the first day. Why didn't I do it yet ?</p>
<p>First because it was not available where I live (before in Singapore, now in France).
I know I can still order it from US or buy on eBay, but no. I do not like to buy items that are not available where I'm because I know it will be painfull to use (what happen if it fails ? ....)</p>
<p>Second, because of the price. I think my limit is 220 USD which is quite the price for US people now.</p>
<p>So, will I get a kindle for Christmas ?
This is not sure...</p>
<pre><code>  * The price is still a little bit to high (when I place the order... the price goes to 334 USD to be compared to my 220 USD limit ...+50% )
  * I need to check which books are really available (this a quite important point !). Should be ok, books are read are mainly in english and about tech topics.
  * I also need to know which french newspapers are availabble (I know &quot;le monde&quot; is)
  * Finally, I'm not sure about the wireless connection. Is it 3G ? Wifi ? Will it work in France ? If I go in other countries (Italy, Singapore, ...) will it work ?
</code></pre>
<p>One strange thing is that amazon do not really communicate or tease about it.</p>
<p>So, let's think about it... and maybe wait for an android eBook ?</p>
<p><strong>[Update] :</strong>
I've found avery good blog about kindle : simply &quot;<a href="http://blogkindle.com/">Blog Kindle</a>&quot;
In this article <a href="http://blogkindle.com/2009/10/international-release-of-kindle-2/">International Release for Kindle 2 !</a> I've learnt that :</p>
<pre><code>  * the kindle available is the &quot;kindle 2&quot; while last version is Kindle DX...
  * the kindle is available for France Italy
  * the kindle is not available for Singapore (strange)
</code></pre>
<p>Will I buy it for Christmas... I still do not know !</p>
