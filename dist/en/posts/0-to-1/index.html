<p>Book title : &quot;0 to 1 - Notes on startups, or how to build the future&quot;</p>
<p>Author : <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel">Peter Thiels</a></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Peter Thiel is is a co-founder of PayPal, Palantir Technologies and Founders Fund . In this book he gives his view on how to create a new successful business :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to be a real game changer, a new business is nit a copy of an existing one. The Idea has to be totally new. From 0 to 1. Not from n to n+1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monopoly is key. The new business has to be so new that it will be a monopoly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The book is very practical and full of anecdotes and real examples.</p>
<h1>My notes</h1>
<blockquote>Doing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1.

<blockquote>Today our challenge is to both imagine and create the new technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than the 20th.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Positively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.

<blockquote>This pessimistic undercurrent drove then-president Bush 41 out of office and won Ross Perot nearly 20% of the popular vote in ’92—the best showing for a third-party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

<blockquote>children, it cost Microsoft and Google their dominance: Apple came along and overtook them all. In January 2013, Apple’s market capitalization was $500 billion, while Google and Microsoft combined were worth $467 billion. Just three years before, Microsoft and Google were each more valuable than Apple. War is costly business.

<blockquote>Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Eroom’s law—that’s Moore’s law backward—observes that the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved every nine years since 1950.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Biotech is difficult because we didn’t design our bodies, and the more we learn about them, the more complex they turn out to be.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>progress without planning is what we call “evolution.”
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Making small changes to things that already exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find the global maximum.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best.

<blockquote>When Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought we should at least consider it. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the board meeting and announced: “Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.”

<blockquote>In 1906, economist Vilfredo Pareto discovered what became the “Pareto principle,” or the 80-20 rule, when he noticed that 20% of the people owned 80% of the land in Italy
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Remember our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on?
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>All fundamentalists think this way, not just terrorists and hipsters. Religious fundamentalism, for example, allows no middle ground for hard questions: there are easy truths that children are expected to rattle off, and then there are the mysteries of God, which can’t be explained.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>When a cheap laptop beats the smartest mathematicians at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs can’t beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more or less powerful than each other—they’re categorically different.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>And that’s the point: computers are tools, not rivals.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>Why do so many people miss the power of complementarity?
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>But when indefinitely optimistic investors betting on the general idea of green energy funded cleantech companies that lacked specific business plans, the result was a bubble.
