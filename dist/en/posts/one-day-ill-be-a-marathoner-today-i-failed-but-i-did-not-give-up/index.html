<h1>today I failed, but I did not give up !&#39;</h1>

<hr>

<p>Today I ran the <a href="http://www.marathonsingapore.com/">Singapore half marathon.</a> with 20 000 other people.
This was the second time in my life I ran such a distance, the first time it was in<a href="http://www.marathondulac-annecy.com/"> Annecy </a>(France) last april.
This half-marathon was supposed to be a check of my progression that will bring me to become a marathoner.</p>
<p>During this race, everything went wrong. I did not feel good at the start (too hot), I never found a good pace, and started to be feel really bad at km 9...</p>
<p>This has been a terrible experience.
I was supposed to be here to beat my personal record (2h06 min) in order to secure the possibility to run a full marathon next april.</p>
<p>When I understood that it will not be possible, and that I'll have to fight to finish in less thant 2h30, the feeling was really terrible.</p>
<p>Finally, I did not give up, I fight for 2 hours and 26 minutes, which is a very long time, and I arrived safe to the finish line. That was one of the worse sports experience in my life.</p>
<p>My conclusion after that race is that :</p>
<ul>
<li>running is a very difficult sport when things go wrong.</li>
<li>I'm quite sure that 50 % of my failure is due to mental aspects</li>
<li>running in Singapore with hot weather and a lot of humidity has a big impact on my performance</li>
<li>I'll not run the marathon next april, I'll try again the half marathon to progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Tonight I'm very disappointed, but I'll take 3 to 4 weeks of rest and start again to train !</p>
