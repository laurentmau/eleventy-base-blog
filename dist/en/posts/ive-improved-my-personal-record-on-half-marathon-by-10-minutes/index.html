<p>I'm still folowing my objective to become a marathoner.</p>
<p>On april 15 I ran half-marathon for the 3rd time.</p>
<p>My first run was 1 year ago in Annecy (France), it went well, and it took me 2h 06 min to finish.</p>
<p>In december I did another try in Singapore, it <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/one-day-ill-be-a-marathoner-today-i-failed-but-i-did-not-give-up/">went really very bad</a>, and I finished the race totally exhausted in a terrible 2h26 minutes.</p>
<p>This new attempt was very important as I had 2 objectives : forget the Singapore failure, and improve my last year time to confirm that I'm on the good path to achieve a marathon soon!</p>
<h4>Everything went well and I crossed the finish line in a very good (for me !) 1h56 min.</h4>
<p>It's 10 min, better than last year. It's an average speed of 11.0 km/h (last year was 10km/h).</p>
<h4>Why did I improve ?</h4>
<p>because every race I build experience. Last year was my first ever 21.1km run. This year it was the 3rd one</p>
<p>because the weather was very good : 7 degres, small rain. I've learnt that this is an ideal weather to run</p>
<p>because I was confident about my objective : some good training sessions showed me I was able to run at 11km/h</p>
<p>because I was not alone. 2 colleagues ran with me and helped me to keep the good pace</p>
<p>because I'm improving at running  ! I just started to run 2 years ago, so I'm still improving</p>
<p>because I did some &quot;qualitative&quot; training not just running to build my endurance skill.</p>
<h4>So what is next ?</h4>
<p>My new next objective is to run Paris marathon in 1 year from now.</p>
<p>Before that, I'll run Paris-Versailles (17km) in september to keep an intermediate objective.</p>
<p>I've now one full year to improve and be ready !</p>
