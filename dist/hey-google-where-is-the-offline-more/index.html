Offline mode is really a missing feature especially  for people who travel.</p>

<p>2 years ago, google used to use a plugin “google gear” to implement a minimal offline mode : mails were accessible and documents were in read-only mode.</p>
<p>Where are we 2 years later ?</p>
<p>Nowhere.</p>
<p>Google <a class="zem_slink" title="Google Gears" href="http://gears.google.com/" rel="homepage">gears</a> has disappeared.</p>
<p>For gmail an application is available in the chrome webstore, but it’s not really good as it’s not consistent with the normal way to access gmail.</p>
<p>Google promised to implement offline using html5, but it’s still not available.</p>
<p>If anyone knows about the roadmap, let me know !</p>
