Of course, Amazon is Customer centric. Of course Amazon is a company that innovate a lot. What is very interesting is that <a class="zem_slink" title="Jeff Bezos" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos" rel="wikipedia">Jeff Bezos</a> (Amazonâ€™s CEO) explains that <strong>frugality</strong> (spending less) is a boost for innovation.
