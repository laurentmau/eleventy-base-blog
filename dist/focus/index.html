I like new year time. It&#8217;s a time when business really slows down for few days and when I&#8217;ve time to think about long-term stuff. It&#8217;s a good time to take a fresh start and take some good new-year resolutions. For example, one of the best resolutions I took was back in &#8217;12 when [I decided to implement](http://laurentmaumet.com/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/) &#8220;Zen To Done&#8221; productivity method from Leo Babauta, it really changed my life.
<p>Of course like all of us I’m struggling to find sustainable new year resolutions that I’ll not forget after few weeks or even few days.</p>
<p>For this year, I’ve been inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bcurdy">Benoit Curdy</a> who proposed to make it simple and only take 1 word (he took <a href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.jcsmm65xy">“Quality”</a> for this year).</p>
<p>For me, the word will be <strong>“Focus”</strong>. For 2016, in all my actions I’ll focus as much as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>in meetings, I’ll be 100% focused on what happen in the room (i.e. not checking my phone, browsing the internet or answering emails)</li>
<li>when I’ll be with someone I’ll focus on what he or she is telling me</li>
<li>I’ll keep only 1 browser tab open to focus on the action I’m currently doing (writing a document, answering an email, reading news, …). I took this one from a <a href="http://zenhabits.net/single/">recent post</a> from Leo Babauta, I already tried it, it’s not easy, but cool.</li>
<li>to create new habits, I’ll focus only on 1 per month (taking 30 days challenges)</li>
<li>every week I’ll choose which big project I want to focus on to make a move</li>
<li>when I run (I do it 4 times per week) I’ll listen to nothing and just focus on the run (not all runs, but maybe 1 / week)</li>
<li>I’ll read only 1 book at a time (I’ve currently 4 books in progress)</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>What I expect from this focus is:</p>
<ul>
<li>be more efficient avoiding multitasking, and being really concentrated</li>
<li>be able to move on a big complicated project by focusing on 1 specific action</li>
<li>be a better manager for my team</li>
<li>be a better dad and husband</li>
</ul>
<p>This word “Focus” will be always in my mind.<br>
In order to change my behaviour, I’ll proceed step by step and implement changes 1 by 1, with focus! (not trying to do all objectives that are in the post starting tomorrow) .</p>
