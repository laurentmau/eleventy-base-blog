<p>I took this photo in Pelleautier Lake in French Alps.</p>
<p>It was a sunny day (like very often in the area).</p>
<p>The moutain in background is the “Pic de Bure”.</p>
<p>This post is part of a serie of posts in which I present my best photos. All of them have been taken by me. The quality is not professionnal of course, but I love them.</p>
