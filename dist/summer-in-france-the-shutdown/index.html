For french people, this summer shutdown is “normal”.<br>
Everybody take between 2 and 4 weeks of Holiday in summer, and everybody is back to work beginning of September.</p>
<p>When I say everybody, it’s everybody, even our president.</p>
<p>After my 2 years spent in Asia, I see pro and cons to this summer break (this break is absolutely not done in Asia).</p>
<p>Of course, the big issue is that everything is delayed.<br>
For example, to plan an IT project, if July/August is in the timeline, it’s mandatory to add 1 month (it’s sure that you’ll go 2 time slower compare to other months).</p>
<p>But in term of global efficiency, maybe it’s not so bad :</p>
<ul>
<li>in september, everybody come fresh and in good shape with a lot of energy</li>
<li>for the balance between family and work, it allows everybody to be sure to be able to spend at least 1 week in family</li>
</ul>
<p>So finally, I’m not sure if France would be more efficient without this shutdown, but I’m convinced that for people it’s more healthy to have it !</p>
<p>I do not know how it’s in US.</p>
