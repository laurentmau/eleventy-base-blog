<p>Usually I travel via Paris airport, using Air France plane.<br>
This time, I decided to change and to try Qantas Airways via London.</p>
<p>The initial reason of this change were :<br>
– avoid Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and the very bad experience I’ve everytime with the security controls and the organisation of the airport<br>
– flight on an Airbus A380</p>
<p>Doing this, I had to change my habbits and buy a Qantas Airways ticket i stead of Air France.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that I’m fully happy about this choice !</p>
<p>– in London heathrow, everything went smoothly, no big queue, a good organisation at security checks.</p>
<p>– Qantas airways is a real customer oriented company. You can feel it immediatly on board when the announce is not done by a “chef de cabine” but by the “customer care manager”. And this is not bullshit. People on board seems to be really committed to make you happy during the flight.</p>
<p>– The A380 experience is great : more space (few cm… but very important for my long legs), very good and modern Entertainment system.</p>
<p>So, even if I’m french, I can tell you that London + Qantas Airways &gt; Paris + Air France.</p>
