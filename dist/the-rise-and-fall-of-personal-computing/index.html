<p>I love this chart from <a href="http://www.asymco.com/">asymco.com</a>, because it shows in 1 page this acceleration.</p>
<p>The Y scale is a logarithmic scale and even like this we can see that Android and iPad growth is just crasy compare to the whole history.</p>
<p>It shows also very well ho ;obile devices are boo;ing and are now more important than traditionnal personnal computing devices (PC, Mac).</p>
<p>Where will it stop ?</p>
