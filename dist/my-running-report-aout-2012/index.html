Last time I’ve posted about my running experience was in april after my very good run in <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/ive-improved-my-personal-record-on-half-marathon-by-10-minutes/" title="I’ve improved my personal record on half-marathon by 10 minutes !">Annecy Half-Marathon</a> when I improved my personnal record by 10 minutes.</p>
<p>5 months ago.</p>
<p>These 5 months have been difficult in term of running due to a bad muscle pain in the thigh .</p>
<p>Just after the race, the pain was so strong that it was even difficult to walk.</p>
<p>I had to rest a lot for it to heal.</p>
<p>From may to July I ran less than 50 km in total ! (I ran 105 km just in 1 month in march).</p>
<p>Starting mid-august, I have been able to run again around 2/3 times per week, and I’m very happy !</p>
<p>In order to prevent the pain to come back, doctors have asked me to strech more and build some abdominal muscle. I’m focusing on it…</p>
<p>My next objective is still the Paris Marathon, on April 7th 2013 !</p>
<p>I’ll be ready !</p>
