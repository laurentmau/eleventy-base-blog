<p>People often ask me about which methodology I use to drive the migration to the cloud of IT systems.</p>
<p>In fact, the methodology I use is a public one. It has been published in 2011 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra">Vivek Kundra</a> (former Federal CIO) and is simply called “FEDERAL CLOUD COMPUTING STRATEGY”.</p>
<p>This document cannot be found online but I kept it for you, it’s here :</p>

<p>It’s 32 pages, and it’s very easy to read.</p>
<p>It first explains the expected benefits of the cloud and then proposes a concrete approach to structure the migration.</p>
