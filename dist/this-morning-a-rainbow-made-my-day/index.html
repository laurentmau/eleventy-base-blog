    Htis morning, bad weather here, cloudy and rainy. <br />Because it&#8217;s automn, sun comes quite late (after 8am). <br />So I was driving in bad mood, because of the weather, the cold, the rain, and suddenly, in front of me a wonderfull rainbow, done by some sun that came throw a hole in the clouds. <br />Just magic (the photo is not done by me, driving, I couldn&#8217;t take it, but the atmosphere was similar).

    Life is so simple sometimes, a simple rainbow in the morning while driving to work and you feel good !
