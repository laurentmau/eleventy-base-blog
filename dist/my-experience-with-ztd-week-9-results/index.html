<p>This is the report #9 of my experimental implementation of  <a title="Zen To Done" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" rel="homepage">Zen To Done</a> the productivity methodology by <a title="Leo Babauta" href="http://zenhabits.net/about/" rel="homepage">Leo Babauta</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the first habit I’ve decided to implement 9 weeks ago  is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.</p>
<p>The 2nd one I started to implement 3 weeks ago is to manage emails to stay inbox 0 and for this to spend 30 minutes per day in an “email cleaning” session.</p>
<p>I’m really happy with the result of these 2 new habbits.</p>
<p>Defining 3 MITs everyday really helps to stay focused.</p>
<p>Of course many times it does not goes as planned, and achieving the MITs is not always possible, but at list I achieve some, and I know what to focus on next day.</p>
<p><strong>Next week I’ll not try to implement any new routine, but I’ll still focus on :</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>** define 3 MITs (**and do them !)</li>
<li><strong>do a 30 min email cleaning</strong> session everyday to come back to inbox 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results next week …</p>
