<p>The power of less is a book by <a class="zem_slink" title="Leo Babauta" href="http://zenhabits.net/about/" rel="homepage">Leo Babauta</a>. This book is full of good stuff.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is about <strong>“The art of setting limits”</strong>.</p>
<p>Chapter  main idea :</p>
<p>[h4]Setting limits is mandatory and is a iterative process[/h4]<br>
Our time and space is limited, so we need to focus on limited items.</p>
<p>If you just take all comes to you, you’ll not be able to achieve it. you’ll have to many actions to do, to many phone call to give, and so on…</p>
<p>If you live without limits, it weaknens you in many ways, it dilutes your power and effectivness.</p>
<p>You can set limits on emails, daily tasks, the amount of time spent on the phone, the number of projects you have on your plate, …</p>
<p>To set the limits, you have to find the good number of items that fit to you.</p>
<p>For this you’ll have to analyse your habit and define a limit, test it for a week, adjust, and adjust again.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from the book :</p>
<p>[blockquote_with_author author=”Leo Babauta”]</p>
<ol>
<li>Analyze your current usage levels (how many times do you do something a day ?) and pick a lower limit based on what you think would be ideal</li>
<li>Test it out for about a week, and then analyze whether that’s working for you.</li>
<li>If it doesn’t work, adjust to a new level you think might work better, and test that out for about a week.</li>
<li>Continue to adjust until you find the right level and until you make it a habit.</li>
</ol>
