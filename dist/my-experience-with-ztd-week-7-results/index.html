<p>This is the report #7 of my experimental implementation of  <a title="Zen To Done" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" rel="homepage">Zen To Done</a> the productivity methodology by <a title="Leo Babauta" href="http://zenhabits.net/about/" rel="homepage">Leo Babauta</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the first habit I’ve decided to implement 7 weeks ago  is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.</p>
<p>The 2nd one I started to implement last week is to manage emails to stay inbox 0 and for this to spend 30 minutes per day in an “email cleaning” session.</p>
<p>During week #1, the success rate has been<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/" title="week 1"> 52 % (11/21)</a> , during week #2, it has been <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week #2 results (3 MITs per day) : 47% success !">47% (9/19)</a>, and during week #3, a total failure (<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 3 results (3 MITs per day) : 6% success (94% failure…)">6%</a>), week #4 had been better : <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 4 results (3 MITs per day) : 59 % success !">59% success</a> , week #5 has been so far the best week, with <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 5 results (3 MITs per day) : 78 % success !">78% succes</a> , week #6 went done with a <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-6-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 6 results (3 MITs per day) : 39 % success !">39% success</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[h4]Here’re the results of week #7 :[/h4][list_check]<br>
[li] **3 MITs for the week : **Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES, How many did I achieve : 2/3[/li]<br>
[li]**Day 1 (March 5th) : **Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :0/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]<br>
**[li]Day 2  (March 6th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]<br>
**[li]Day 3 (<strong>March 7th</strong>) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]<br>
**[li]Day 4 (March 8th) :**Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]<br>
**[li]Day 5 (March 9th) : **Did I define 3 MITs ? : Yes, How many did I achieve : 2/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]<br>
**[li]Total : I’ve defined the MITs everyday, I’ve achieved  9/18 (50%).[/li]  **[/list_check]</p>
<p>[h4]What are  my conclusions ?[/h4]<br>
[list_check]<br>
[li]9/18  is  a “standard” week.[/li]<br>
[li]The new email habbit has not been so successfull yet.  I did it the first 2 days and then did not really stick to it (even if I still manage my emails !)[/li]<br>
[li]Defining MITs everyday really helped me to be (at least feel) efficient ![/li][/list_check]</p>
<p><strong>Next week I’ll not try to implement any new routine, but just have better result on the emails !</strong></p>
<p>Results next week …</p>
