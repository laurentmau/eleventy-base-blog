<p>I’ve been a happy user of <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/gtd-why-i-switched-from-nirvana-to-wunderlist/">wunderlist</a></p>
<p>for some months, but some synchronization bugs that impacted my lists (the lists were not the same between devices) make me lose confidence and that’s not a good situation for a todo manager!</p>
<p>Looking around I came to <a href="http://todoist.com/">todoist</a></p>
<p>I’m using it for 6 months and I’ve even subscribed a premium account last week (first time for me !).</p>
<p>If you are looking for a todo application (and even if you are not) I highly recommend you to have a look at todoist, I promise you’ll not regret it.</p>
<p>The main reasons that make me happy about it are :</p>
<p> </p>
<h4 id="1--simplicity-%7B%23simplicity%7D">1- simplicity {#simplicity} <a class="direct-link" href="#1--simplicity-%7B%23simplicity%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>todoist is very simple with no extra features.<br>
The UI is ‘human-oriented’, for example, if you want to plan a task for tomorrow, you just write ‘tomorrow’ in the date field…<br>
The interface is clean, no extra buttons.</p>
<h4 id="2--all-devices-and-gmail-integration-%7B%23all-devices-and-gmail-integration%7D">2- all devices and Gmail integration {#all-devices-and-gmail-integration} <a class="direct-link" href="#2--all-devices-and-gmail-integration-%7B%23all-devices-and-gmail-integration%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>It’s a must-have for a todo manager to be accessible from all devices. Todoist web is very efficient, the Android and iPad applications gave me great experience.<br>
I use it mainly for my android phone on mobility but also in chrome when I’m on my laptop.<br>
The chrome extension is great.<br>
As I’m a Gmail user, I appreciate the Gmail integration that allows me to transform an email into action in just 1 click.</p>
<h4 id="3--projects%2C-sub-projects%2C-tasks%2C-subtasks%2C-labels-%7B%23projects-sub-projects-tasks-sub-tasks-labels%7D">3- projects, sub-projects, tasks, subtasks, labels {#projects-sub-projects-tasks-sub-tasks-labels} <a class="direct-link" href="#3--projects%2C-sub-projects%2C-tasks%2C-subtasks%2C-labels-%7B%23projects-sub-projects-tasks-sub-tasks-labels%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>Managing my todo, I need to structure tasks to group them by topic or project, …<br>
todoist is very flexible for that. It offers to create projects, and subprojects, and even subtasks.<br>
It’s very nice.<br>
It’s even possible to use tags (just by adding @tag) in the task description.<br>
So I can organise my tasks very easily,</p>
<h4 id="4--sharing-with-others-%7B%23sharing-with-others%7D">4- sharing with others {#sharing-with-others} <a class="direct-link" href="#4--sharing-with-others-%7B%23sharing-with-others%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>Even with the free version, you can share tasks with others.<br>
You can share a project (everybody will see all the tasks within the project), and assign a task to a specific person.<br>
It’s the first time I see a todo tool really good for sharing actions.</p>
<h4 id="5--apis-%7B%23apis%7D">5- APIs {#apis} <a class="direct-link" href="#5--apis-%7B%23apis%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>todoist offers a REST API to access your actions, it opens a lot of possibilities for future integration. I’m starting to play with it, and plan to integrate some statistics about my actions in my ‘personnal analytics’ dashboard (more about that soon).</p>
<h4 id="6--and-even-fun!-%7B%23and-even-fun%7D">6- and even fun! {#and-even-fun} <a class="direct-link" href="#6--and-even-fun!-%7B%23and-even-fun%7D">#</a></h4>
<p>todoist implement a metric ‘the karma’ that monitor your level of productivity. If you add action, complete them on time, the karma goes up. If you have late actions, the karma goes down.<br>
It’s not very important, but it’s fun and gives some motivation when I tend to be out of control and don’t update my actions…</p>
