My answer is :</p>
<h4 id="1--lower-cost-of-ownership">1- Lower cost of ownership <a class="direct-link" href="#1--lower-cost-of-ownership">#</a></h4>
<p>Going to the cloud means the big modification, infrastructure sharing, same software for all. This will necessarily bring lower cost of ownership.</p>
<h4 id="2--better-functionalities.">2- Better functionalities. <a class="direct-link" href="#2--better-functionalities.">#</a></h4>
<p>Cloud based applications (Software as a service) are new software. They use last available technologies and implement new functional concepts. The major improvement is about collaboration. Because ‘file’ as we knew it for ever does not exist anymore, people can collaborate easily in a totally new way.</p>
