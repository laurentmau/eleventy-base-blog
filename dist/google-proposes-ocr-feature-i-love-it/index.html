<p>Google now proposes an experimental service to convert text scanned in image format (JPG, PNG or GIF format).</p>
<p>OCR is a very useful functionality on a day to day basis (especially at work) because even if everything is digitalized, we still have printed version, example to contract), and when we need to do a new document, based on a printed one, OCR is needed.</p>
<p>I like this feature which is a good example of google added value.</p>
<p>They have google docs, they develop OCR for google books ( and also for search engine that convert pdf in html), and they just propose it as a simple service for us.</p>
