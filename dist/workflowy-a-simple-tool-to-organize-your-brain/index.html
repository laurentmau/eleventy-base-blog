<p>“lists” are not just your action lists, it’s all kind of lists: a list of ideas when you brainstorm, a list of posts you plan to write, …</p>
<p>Workflowy does not have any fancy features (like projects, due dates, …), it’s very simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>Workflowy is a web-based application, registration is very easy.</p>
<p>To start, workflowy is just a simple white page where you can enter all your lists. No need to enter “edit” mode or to “save”, all your changes are immediately recorded.</p>
<p>What makes workflowy special and very good to use is the very simple and intuitive way to browse your lists.<br>
You can build lists with thousands of items without being lost. Everything is easily structured and organized.</p>
<p>I love it and use it daily.</p>
<p>The video will show you in detail the concept.</p>
<p>If you try it, let me know if you like it!</p>
