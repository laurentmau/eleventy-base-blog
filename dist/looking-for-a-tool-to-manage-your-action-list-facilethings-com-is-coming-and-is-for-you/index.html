I can here your questions coming : “What ? 1 more tool to manage actions ? Why should I try it ?”.<br>
Here’re 3 reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://facilethings.com">facilethings.com</a> is really GTD compliant, it’s even a very good GTD tutorial.</strong><br>
In the different screens you know at which step you’re (collect, process,…) and a quick text explain you very clearly what you have to do.<br>
This is for me what makes this tool special and good to use.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://facilethings.com">facilethings.com</a> is simple and efficient.</strong><br>
The design is very nice : simple, elegant, with an easy access to the different functions.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://facilethings.com">facilethings.com</a> implement the most important functions</strong> that are needed for a start.<br>
For example, the recurring tasks are already there. In many other tools recurring tasks are not implemented, and it’s a big miss as we all have recurring tasks !</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure of the roadmap of the application, for me, it should concentrate on :</p>
<ul>
<li>implementing projects</li>
<li>creating mobile applications for android and iphone/ipad.</li>
<li>of course, it’s very important to keep the fresh and nice design !</li>
</ul>
