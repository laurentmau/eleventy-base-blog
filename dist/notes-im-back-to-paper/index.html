<p>I’ve tried to stick to evernote for more than 1 year.</p>
<p>I’ve installed the application on my blackberry, on my laptop, on my iPad, but it still not the good system.</p>
<p>I’ve found that using an electronic application to take notes on the spot has few drawbacks that are killers :</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not fast enough :<br>
When you want to take a new note you have to switch the device on, launch the application, sometimes login, create a new note, and then you can start to take notes using the keyboard, which is often slower than writing with a pen.</li>
<li>You are limited to letters :<br>
When I take notes, sometimes I want to draw , or to organise the words. On an lelectronic system it’s not possible</li>
<li>Sometime it bugs :<br>
Sometimes it’s due to network issues (“connection lost”),  sometimes it’s because I forget to push the “save” button. The “Lost” not experience is very frustrating</li>
<li>It “kills” the human contact with people :<br>
When you use a device to take notes, people thinks that you’re sending emails, or sms, which give a bad impression and kills the contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of all this, I’m back to paper.</p>
