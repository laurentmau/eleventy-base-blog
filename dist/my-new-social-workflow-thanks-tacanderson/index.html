<p><span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time">&lt; 1</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minute</span></span>I read all posts written by <a class="zem_slink" title="my life stream" href="http://www.tacanderson.com" rel="homepage">Tac Anderson</a> on his blog <a href="http://www.newcommbiz.com/">newcommbiz</a>.</p>
<p>Last wednesday Tac published a very interesting post about his <a href="http://www.newcommbiz.com/my-social-media-workflow/">new social workflow</a>.</p>
<p>This post is very good because it’s very clear, concrete and explains everything about Tac’s organisation on social medias ( to publish posts on his blogs, Twitter, facebook, to share good links, …).</p>
<p>I let you read it for further details.</p>
<p>Based on this, I’ve improved and updated my own system.</p>
<p>The main changes are :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I’ve created a new blog on tumblr : <a href="http://lmaulight.tumblr.com/">lmaulight</a>.</strong><br>
I’ll post on this blog all the links I share : my own blog posts and other good posts I find.<br>
I’ll also post photos I take (not sure what I’ll do with <a href="https://path.com/">path</a>).<br>
If you want to follow everything about me , just follow it !</li>
<li><strong>I’ve also decided to use <a href="http://www.diigo.com/user/laurentmaumet">diigo</a>.</strong><br>
<a class="zem_slink" title="Diigo" href="http://www.diigo.com" rel="homepage">Diigo</a> seems to be more than a bookmarking tool, but for a start I’ll use it just for this purpose : it will collect all the good links I find and help me to retrieve them.<br>
Later I’ll see if I can do more with it.</li>
</ol>

  To implement this, I use<a href="http://ifttt.com"> ifttt.com</a> and <a href="http://bufferapp.com/dashboard">buffer </a>as recommended by Tac.

  I&#8217;ve not yet implemented a facebook page. I&#8217;m thinking about it, but not decided yet&#8230;
