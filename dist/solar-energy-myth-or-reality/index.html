<p>Yesterday (May 29th 2009)  I did attend SOLARCON in Singapore.</p>
<p>One afternoon of overlook of Solar energy business.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy">Solar</a> is about producing electricity using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics">PhotoVoltaic</a> (PV) technology.<br>
After this afternoon, here are my ideas, my questions about this market:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">he market is very promising</span>, a lot of nice charts that show a wonderful market in … 2100</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The ecosystem is not ready</span>.<br>
For example, for PV panels are done using silicon, historically, silicon market is shared by 8 big players. Today, 120 companies are ramping up in china. The forecast is to keep 20-30 players.<br>
The prices went from 140$ / kg to 60 $/kg. No real idea of forecast.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The grid parity</span> (solar electricity at competitive price) <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">s</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">hould be reached in 2012</span> in area with high electricity coast / lot of sun like Italy and California.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Current crisis has an impact on development</span> : big investments are needed, and banks to not loan money these days.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The technology is improving a lot</span>, often, so investment done today may be obsolete soon</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Biggest countries (US, India, China) recently announced big plans</span> to increase solar part in electricity production. Because they think green…and also because it’s a good way to develop economy during the crisis.<br>
To meet these targets of solar electricity production for 2030, the production of solar panel have to be <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">9 times bigger than what it is this year… for the next 20 years</span>.. (sounds crazy, no ?)</li>
<li>To sustain ecosystem, all players ask the  <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">governments to give grants and to fix the electricity rates.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> </span></span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Smartgrid is mandatory</span> for efficient solar electricity production.</li>
</ul>
<p>My feeling after these presentations is good, but a lot of very big investments have to be done, it will take time.<br>
Politics help will be needed to sustain these very long term investments.</p>
<p>[Update 2012 : it seems twitter do not keep old tweets, the link below does not work anymore today]</p>
<p>During the presentations, I’ve updated my twitter using the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23solarcon+">#solarcon</a> tag (surprisingly, nobody else did this), so you can find my notes there.</p>
