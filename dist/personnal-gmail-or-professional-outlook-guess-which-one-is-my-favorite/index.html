<p>As many people, to work day to day, I use outlook which is a corporate tool, and gmail for my private emails, because it’s free and convenient.<br>
Of course, outlook is a good tool, this is why we use it.<br>
What I like much in outlook is :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it’s working quite fine : no major issues,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performances are good, management of poor connections is fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the agenda management is great and very useful in compagny context,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the synchronization with my blackberry is efficient</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it’s fully integrated with windows, no need to login again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outlook is fully integrated with other Microsoft tools (office, MOCS, portal), and it’s convenient</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But… When I compare it to gmail I use for personal purpose… I’m disappointed, and I m sure some functionality are missing to make my life better, and make my job more efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In gmail, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mails are organized by conversations</span>, and not just listed like in outlook.<br>
This is really a great feature to make emails easily accessible.<br>
I’ve tried to reproduce it in outlook, but with no success. The tool is not design for it, so it does not really work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In gmail, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mails can be tagged</span>. this is also great and efficient for me (instead of putting emails in different folders, you can access by tag or by the full list of emails)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search is of course very good</span> (engine by Google), so you can very easily retrieve emails base on sender name or keywords, which is really more painful in outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I can access to my mailbox from every PCs in the world</span>, with no limitation, with the same level of functionality. This is a key point for me. Daily I use 3 different pcs + my blackberry. I can access my mailbox easily on all these pcs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No backup issue</span>. With outlook, part of my emails are on the exchange server and so are backuped by compagny servers, put a huge amount is store in separate pst files…<br>
That are stored on my laptop…<br>
I ve to do manual backup of it, and I do not like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">all my emails are always accessible</span> (no special pst folder, no size limit the 2gb limit for outlook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">in gmail, I ve access to all my friends via IM and video chat</span> (which can be done by additional product by Microsoft)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gmail is <span style="font-weight: bold;">integrated with google reader</span> : To follow my rss feeds, I use googlereader. When I want to send an article by email from Google reader… It uses my gmail account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gmail propose often new features,</span> I can implement if I want to (via googlelabs)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So why do we continue to use outlook, what could trigger a change to gmail ?</p>
<p>Outlook / exchange is a company level decision, all the considerations in this post are only for the client point of view, so to assess to gap before a switch, it would be necessary to consider full picture, but the major issue I see today is <span style="font-weight: bold;">: to use gmail, you need to trust Google about data confidentiality and safety</span>.</p>
<p>In business the confidentiality of information that go throw emails is essential( I do not care about it for my personal stuff).<br>
Today we are even using additional tools to encrypt confidential email we exchange.<br>
Going to Google or other SAAS solution would be a huge concern for this.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I do not see today how to solve it and secure people about it</span>.</p>
<p>I’m sure it will come, but I do not see when.</p>
<p>The situation is the same with people that were afraid to put their money to the bank and prefer to keep it at home in a small box…<br>
The arguments were the same… “if I give it to the bank I do not know where it is, what will they do with this …”</p>
