<p>2011  was my first complete year of running :</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran 1 045 kilometers, 2 times more than 2010.</li>
<li>I ran 112 times, which is 2.15 times per week.</li>
<li>I ran during 113 hours and 58 min.</li>
<li>I burned 96 672 calories</li>
<li>I ran in France, Germany, USA, Singapore, Indonesia, Spain.</li>
<li>I raced 3 times, 2 half-marathon (Annecy and <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/one-day-ill-be-a-marathoner-today-i-failed-but-i-did-not-give-up/" title="singapore">Singapore</a>) and a 16 km race (Paris-Versailles).</li>
<li>I beat my longer run record running my first half marathon in 2h6min.</li>
<li>I beat my 10km record in 59 minutes, (during the half marathon).</li>
<li>I learned to practice interval running</li>
<li>I was injured 1 time</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve really enjoyed to be serious at running, and I plan to continue this year.</p>
<p>My plan for this year is to run again a half-marathon in april, and if it goes well, I’ll run my first marathon in automn.</p>
<p>And you, do you run ?</p>
