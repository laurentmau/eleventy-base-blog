<p>I started to run seriously in June 2010, 18 months ago.</p>

<p>My objective is to be able to run a marathon. This should happen this year in october in Amsterdam (to be confirmed).</p>
<p>My short term objective is to run the Annecy half-Marathon on apritl 15th.</p>
<p>I ran this race in 2011 in 2:07.</p>
<p>The objective for this year is to go below 2 hours.</p>
<p>This will be a big challenge as my agenda is really full in the next months.</p>
<p>In January I ran 39 km. This is quite low, last year I ran 83.</p>
<p>My motivation was not very high, and I did not manage to find the motivation to wake-up at 5:30 am to run in the cold night.</p>
<p>The race is now in 10 weeks, so it’s time to start to run seriously 3 times per week.</p>
