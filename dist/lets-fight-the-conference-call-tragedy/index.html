<p>What we try to avoid is the “conference call tragedy”.</p>
<p>This video explains perfectly what I mean by “conference call tragedy”.</p>
<p>Using a system like Google Hangouts mixing sound, video, document sharing is a strong help to improve this kind of meeting because :<br>
– it’s easier to connect (no need for a pin number, …)<br>
– every participant knows who is connected<br>
– with some video, we bring some “humanity”<br>
– we can share the document easily so be sure everybody is on the same page.</p>
<p>That said, switching from conference call  to Hangouts can be difficult because of some technical problems: you need a correct data connection which sometimes not the case, you need a correct earphone/microphone, people you are interacting with need to have an account or a piece of software, you also need to learn how to use it (even if it’s very easy, still some tricks to know…)<br>
But the biggest barrier to switch is people resistance to change: we have been using phones for so many years…</p>
