<p>This is the report #8 of my experimental implementation of  <a title="Zen To Done" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" rel="homepage">Zen To Done</a> the productivity methodology by <a title="Leo Babauta" href="http://zenhabits.net/about/" rel="homepage">Leo Babauta</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the first habit I’ve decided to implement 8 weeks ago  is to define every morning the 3 Most Important Topics (MITs) I want / need / commit to achieve during the day.</p>
<p>The 2nd one I started to implement 2 weeks is to manage emails to stay inbox 0 and for this to spend 30 minutes per day in an “email cleaning” session.</p>
<p>During week #1, the success rate has been<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-1-results/" title="week 1"> 52 % (11/21)</a> , during week #2, it has been <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-2-results-3-mits-per-day-43-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week #2 results (3 MITs per day) : 47% success !">47% (9/19)</a>, and during week #3, a total failure (<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-3-results-3-mits-per-day-6-success-94-failure/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 3 results (3 MITs per day) : 6% success (94% failure…)">6%</a>), week #4 had been better : <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-4-results-3-mits-per-day-59-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 4 results (3 MITs per day) : 59 % success !">59% success</a> , week #5 has been so far the best week, with <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-5-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 5 results (3 MITs per day) : 78 % success !">78% succes</a> , week #6 went down with a <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-6-results-3-mits-per-day-78-success/" title="My experience with ZTD / Week 6 results (3 MITs per day) : 39 % success !">39% success</a>, week #7 was better with <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-7-results/" title="My experience with ZTD : Week 7 results">50% success</a>.</p>

<p>[h4]Here’re the results of week #8 :[/h4][list_check]<br>
[li] **3 MITs for the week : **Did I defined 3 MITs  ? :  YES, How many did I achieve : 3/3[/li][li]**Day 1 (March 12th) : <strong>Did I defined 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve :2/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]</strong>[li]Day 2  (March 13th) : <strong>Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]</strong>[li]Day 3 (<strong>March 14th</strong>) : <strong>Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 0/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]</strong>[li]Day 4 (March 15th) :<strong>Did I define 3 MITs ? : YES, How many did I achieve : 1/2. Did I clean emails : Yes[/li]</strong>[li]Day 5 (March 16th) : <strong>Did I define 3 MITs ? : NO, How many did I achieve : O/2. Did I clean emails : No[/li]</strong>[li]Total : I’ve defined the MITs 4 times instead of 5, I’ve achieved  11/18 (61%).[/li]  **[/list_check]</p>
<p>[h4]What are  my conclusions ?[/h4]<br>
[list_check]<br>
[li]11/18  is  a “standard” week.[/li]<br>
[li]The new email habbit has  been very successfull.  It helped me a lot to keep under control.[/li]<br>
[li]Defining MITs everyday really helped me to be (at least feel) efficient ![/li][/list_check]</p>
<p><strong>Next week I’ll not try to implement any new routine, but I’ll start again to define 3 MITs, and consider email as a fourth one.</strong></p>
<p>Results next week …</p>
