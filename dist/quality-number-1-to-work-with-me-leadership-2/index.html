<p>Based on my experience, the most important criteria is LEADERSHIP.</p>
<p>Leadership to guide me (a customer does not necessary knows what he needs…)<br>
Leadership to propose solutions<br>
Leadership to take the good decisions to be efficient<br>
Leadership to show the direction.</p>
<p>Leadership is the result of companies culture (do they encourage their staff to take risks? ) but depends even more  on individuals.</p>
