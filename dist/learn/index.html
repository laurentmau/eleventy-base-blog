This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from <a href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benoit Curdy</a> and for 2016 it works for me. I really made progress, it helped me to be more efficient and enjoy life (1 tab in browser is quite challenging but I love it 🙂 )</p>
<p>It’s now time to decide what will be my new word for 2017 and it will be “<strong>Learn</strong>“.</p>
<p>I’ve always been in a “learning” attitude. During my career, I’ve jumped between different topics, businesses, jobs.</p>
<p>Learning new things is key to be able to invent, innovate.</p>
<p>In the tech area, many things are happening: block-chain, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, autonomous cars, chatbots, platforms, and also Arduino, raspberry, IoT, …<br>
The world is changing very fast thanks to new technologies and it’s going faster and faster.</p>
<p>Looking back at what has happened in the last 10 years, is really mind-blowing.</p>

<p>What will happen in the next 10 years?</p>
<p>In order to really understand what is happening, be able to anticipate trends, and innovate I think it’s even more important to learn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My objective for this year will be to spend the time to learn new things, especially in the tech area.<br>
That will include</p>
<ul>
<li>learn more about A.I. I know the theory of neural networks as I studied it in the ’90 but I need to learn how to use it now (could be with google Tensorflow or others)</li>
<li>learn new development languages (should be node.js and Angular.js)</li>
<li>learn how to assemble hardware to build simple automation in my house (could be <a href="http://lifehacker.com/build-a-silent-texting-doorbell-with-an-amazon-dash-bu-1790899374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com/build-an-automated-voice-controlled-cat-feeder-1791033326" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that</a>)</li>
<li>learn more about block-chain (not sure what I can do with that).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to learn I’ll have to :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicate time</strong> to this activity (this means less time other things, I’ll have to make choices)</li>
<li><strong>Read</strong> more and more: As Confucius said: “You cannot open a book without learning something.”. Last year I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/12898931?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 books</a>,  I plan to read at least 15 this year.</li>
<li><strong>Try things, experiment</strong>. I’ll try as much as possible to implement concrete things. Experiment means failure, and failure means learning.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> as much as possible. Share with my friends, my colleagues, my family but also online. I’m a heavy user of Twitter and LinkedIn, I will be more present on Facebook to share and interact with others (especially to learn how it works )</li>
</ul>
