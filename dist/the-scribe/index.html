In such a  case, a good organisation and good processes are mandatory to be efficient.<br>
 <br>
When the crisis in ongoing, people are under pressure. <br>
All the members of the crisis squad are working hard to execute actions to solve the problem. <br>
New events are coming about the environment.<br>
1 key role is the scribe.<br>
The scribe duty is (simply) to write  down what is ongoing : actions performed, news findings, new events…<br>
 <br>
This role is very important because : <br>
– this material will be used  real time by the crisis leader when he makes a status<br>
– the person in charge of crisis communication will find there all informations he needs <br>
– new person coming on board during the crisis will be brieffed using it</p>
