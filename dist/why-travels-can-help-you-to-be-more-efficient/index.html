<p>It’s time consuming, you loose time in the travel, it’s also tiring, because of the travel itself, because of jetlag.</p>
<p>By the way I’ve found that travelling is s also very usefull for me to be efficient Here’s why in 4 points.</p>
<h2 id="breath-!">Breath ! <a class="direct-link" href="#breath-!">#</a></h2>
<p>When travelling, you’re away from operational activities.</p>
<p>It breaks your daily routine, and you’re less involved in operations.</p>
<p>It has 2 good points : the level of stress decrease, and you can breath !</p>
<h2 id="another-perspective.">Another perspective. <a class="direct-link" href="#another-perspective.">#</a></h2>
<p>Being away physically give you another view on what you’re doing. It helps to take a step back and have another analysis on the situation.</p>
<p>This can be very useful to find new solutions.</p>
<h2 id="meet-new-people.">Meet new people. <a class="direct-link" href="#meet-new-people.">#</a></h2>
<p>When travelling you meet new people.</p>
<p>New people means new ways of thinking, new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="discover-your-colleagues.">Discover your colleagues. <a class="direct-link" href="#discover-your-colleagues.">#</a></h2>
<p>Travels is very good way to take time to discuss with your colleagues and really discover them.</p>
<p>Being together away from the company helps people to be less shy and really show who they are.</p>
