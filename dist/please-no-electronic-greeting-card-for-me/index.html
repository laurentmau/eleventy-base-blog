It’s time to think about how to whish all your friends, colleagues, partners,… a “happy new year”.</p>
<p>If you want to send me your wishes, I have to tell you that I don’t like to receive electronics card embedded in an email, because :</p>
<p>– it often does not work. On a laptop, the email open with a bad design and the question “do you want to load pictures?”, on the smartphone, the result is even worth.</p>
<p>– The design is often very bad. Every company tries to do nice stuff but the result is seldom nice…</p>
<p>– people using this kind of electronic cards often send them quickly, just add your email address to a list, with no customization. For me, it is just spam.<br>
The worst case is when the same email is sent to many people as “cci”…</p>
<p>So, when you wish me “all the best”, please try to make it personal, authentic.</p>
<p>A 2 lines email will be perfect!</p>
