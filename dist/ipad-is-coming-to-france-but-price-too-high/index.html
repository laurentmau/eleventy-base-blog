<p>It’s now official, the Ipad will be available in France on the 28rh of may.<br>
The only big issue is the price.</p>
<p>In fact, the price is a same in France and in US (for example, 499 for a 16Gb, WIFI version) but… it’s 499 USD in US and 499 Euro in France !<br>
Which means 30 % more !</p>
<p>The other issue is the price of the 3G plans with phone companies.<br>
Orange proposes 39Euros /month for a 2GB limited connexion. This is huge !<br>
For my Iphone, I pay the same price for unlimited datas and 1 hour of voice.</p>
<p>I know IPad is selling very well in U.S. now, but honestly, I’m not sure I’ll buy one, because of the price…</p>
