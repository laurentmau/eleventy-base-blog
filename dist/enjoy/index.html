<p>My word for 2019 will be “Enjoy”</p>
<h4 id="i-started-with-this-%E2%80%9Cword-of-the-year%E2%80%9D-idea-3-years-ago.">I started with this “word of the year” idea 3 years ago. <a class="direct-link" href="#i-started-with-this-%E2%80%9Cword-of-the-year%E2%80%9D-idea-3-years-ago.">#</a></h4>
<p>This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj" target="_blank">Benoit Curdy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2016, my word of the year was  “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://laurentmaumet.com/focus/" target="_blank">Focus</a>“, which, for me, functioned as a reminder to spend more time on fewer things, avoid multitasking, be more present.</p>
<p>The next year I chose “<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/learn">Learn</a>” and spent more time on learning new <g class="gr_ gr\_21 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="21" data-gr-id="21">things related</g> to digital like coding, big data, machine learning but also <g class="gr_ gr\_81 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="81" data-gr-id="81">lern</g> things related <g class="gr_ gr\_113 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="113" data-gr-id="113">to the</g> personal organization, to geopolitics, to history.</p>
<p>Finally, for 2018, I chose “<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/read/">Read</a>” with a target of 24 books to be read during the year (I finished at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10834395">17</a>), doing some posts about the books (<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/books/">I did it for 2</a>).</p>
<h4 id="for-this-year%2C-my-word-will-simply-be-%E2%80%9Cenjoy%E2%80%9D.">For this year, my word will simply be “Enjoy”. <a class="direct-link" href="#for-this-year%2C-my-word-will-simply-be-%E2%80%9Cenjoy%E2%80%9D.">#</a></h4>
<p>I’ll try as much as I can to enjoy the moment, take time to appreciate a simple meal with my family, time to enjoy visiting a new city, time to enjoy running, looking at nature. To put it <g class="gr_ gr\_16 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">simple</g>, enjoy more all small things that make <g class="gr_ gr\_31 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Style multiReplace" id="31" data-gr-id="31">my life</g>.</p>
<p>For this, I’ll have to calm down, chill out, and also sometime take a step back from my busy schedule. I’ll also have to improve the way I deal with notifications coming from all devices (more on that on a post coming).</p>
<p>I also plan to enjoy more at work.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love my job. I’m really passionate about it, tt’s full of excitement, stimulations, great responsibilities, nice colleagues, … but for this year I want to take time to realize how lucky I’m to hold such a position, to take time to celebrate our great results take time to really enjoy it.</p>
<p>“Enjoy” means also being optimistic. People keep telling me I’m not so bad at it, often I’m the guy that sees the “half-full” glass of water and this why the headline of my blog is “Welcome, Smile, Life is good !”.</p>
<p>Being optimistic is a strong engine for me and I’m convinced it helps to be to be stronger. Recently I’ve realized I’m sometimes less optimistic as I used to be especially in some stressful or boring situations.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep the positive view during this year!</p>
