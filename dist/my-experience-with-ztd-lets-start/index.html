<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Zen To Done" href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/11/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" rel="homepage">Zen To Done</a> (ZTD) is “The Ultimate Simple Productivity System”.</p>
<p>I’ll not describe ZTD here, for more details please go to <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/" title="ztd">Leo’s website</a> to read a summary, or better, buy and read the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-the-simple-productivity-e-book/" title="ztd book">book</a> (I highly recommend it).</p>
<p>One main idea of ZTD is to be pragmatic and to change your habbits one by one.</p>
<p>I’m already a <a class="zem_slink" title="Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity" href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzem-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0142000280" rel="amazon">GTD</a> user since few years, so I’ve already implemented some concepts described in ZTD (collect, process using the 2 minutes rule, …) but I also face the “classical” GTD issues : too many actions, a complicated system to follow them (using the very good application <a href="https://www.nirvanahq.com/" title="nirvanahq">nirvanahq</a>) and a lot of difficulties to do the weekly review.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to do an experiement and to try to implement ZTD concepts and see how it can help me.</p>
<p>The first stage I’ll try  is to implement the habit of defining every morning the 3 MITs (Most Important Topics) that I want to adress during the day (and I commit to myself to …).</p>
<p>As a start, I’ve also drastically simplified my nirvanahq usage : I’ve removed all my projects, and put all the actions in 1 single list.</p>
<p>I started this last Monday (January 16th).</p>
<p>Every week I’ll give here a status of the experiment.</p>
