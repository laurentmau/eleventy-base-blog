This is now sure. Legacy IT is going to the cloud.

  <p>
    Around me, I see people that don&#8217;t really believe it or are reluctant, so here&#8217;re the 4 reasons that can explain why cloud computing is not good for your business :
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      because your IT team does not understand it
    </li>
    <li>
      because you think it&#8217;s safer to keep your money under your bed instead of putting it in a Bank
    </li>
    <li>
      because  you are afraid of  change and love status quo, and you&#8217;re convinced that it was better in the old days
    </li>
    <li>
      because you produce your own electricity and don&#8217;t want to rely on centralized power plants
    </li>
  </ol>

  If none of these are true for you&#8230; believe me, you should proceed!
