<p><span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix">Reading Time: </span> <span class="rt-time">2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes</span></span>This morning, I connected to my favorite <a class="zem_slink" title="Amazon" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage">amazon.fr</a> (yes, I’m in France) to order a book.</p>
<p>And… fantastic news… on the home page, I can read “<strong>The new kindle is now available for ordering</strong>“.</p>
<p>This is a news I’m waiting for months.</p>
<p>The things I’m waiting from a kindle are :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>be able to buy a new book and have it immediatly (yes, I’m quite impatient sometimes…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have just 1 thing to bring in which I’ve all my books. I often read few books at the same time…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have my favorite newspaper directly at home. I love reading newspaper, but it’s sometimes boring to go and buy them (especially in winter, cold weather…)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So this news made me very happy !<br>
I plan to buy a kindle since the first day. Why didn’t I do it yet ?</p>
<p>First because it was not available where I live (before in Singapore, now in France).<br>
I know I can still order it from US or buy on eBay, but no. I do not like to buy items that are not available where I’m because I know it will be painfull to use (what happen if it fails ? ….)</p>
<p>Second, because of the price. I think my limit is 220 USD which is quite the price for US people now.</p>
<p>So, will I get a kindle for Christmas ?<br>
This is not sure…</p>
<ul>
<li>The price is still a little bit to high (when I place the order… the price goes to 334 USD to be compared to my 220 USD limit …+50% )</li>
<li>I need to check which books are really available (this a quite important point !). Should be ok, books are read are mainly in english and about tech topics.</li>
<li>I also need to know which french newspapers are availabble (I know “le monde” is)</li>
<li>Finally, I’m not sure about the wireless connection. Is it 3G ? Wifi ? Will it work in France ? If I go in other countries (Italy, Singapore, …) will it work ?</li>
</ul>
<p>One strange thing is that amazon do not really communicate or tease about it.</p>
<p>So, let’s think about it… and maybe wait for an android eBook ?</p>
<p><strong>[Update] :</strong><br>
I’ve found avery good blog about kindle : simply “<a href="http://blogkindle.com/">Blog Kindle</a>”<br>
In this article <a href="http://blogkindle.com/2009/10/international-release-of-kindle-2/">International Release for Kindle 2 !</a> I’ve learnt that :</p>
<ul>
<li>the kindle available is the “kindle 2” while last version is Kindle DX…</li>
<li>the kindle is available for France Italy</li>
<li>the kindle is not available for Singapore (strange)</li>
</ul>
