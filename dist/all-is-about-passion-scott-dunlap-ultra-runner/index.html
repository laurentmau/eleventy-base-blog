His passion,  his life is about running races longer than a marathon (up to 100 miles,  160 kilometers).<br>
Scott gave a speech at <a class="zem_slink" title="Le Web" href="http://www.leweb.net" rel="homepage">Le Web</a> last week.<br>
The topic was about “internet of things”.<br>
Scott uses devices to monitor his performances : speed,  elevation, calories burnt,…</p>
<p>Running very long discuss is crasy.<br>
It’s a lot of pain.</p>
<p>So why do this ?</p>
<p>Scott answer is very simple : “all is about passion”. I like this statement.<br>
Your content here.One nice device he also uses is a kind of “mood traker”.<br>
Every 30 minutes, Scott press a button to rank his mindset, his mood on a scale from – 4 to +4, <a href="http://i.ie">i.ie</a> from “please kill me now” to “Euphoric”.<br>
The result is very interesting and is repeatable from race to race : Scott mood go up and down 3 times,  with higher and higher intensity.</p>
<p>The 3 “bad mood” states are called “The wall”, “the pit” and “the Abyss”.</p>
<p>Scott explains that he like running because these difficults phases are followed by good ones ! And especially the last one the Euphoria state.</p>
