<p>They are a lot of discussions these days around how Facebook handle it’s user’s data privacy.<br>
I’ve talked about it in a previous <a href="http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2010/05/nightmare-of-facebook-users-data.html">post</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, <strong>I’ve absolutely no issue with this</strong>.<br>
Do you know why ?<br>
Because <strong>I do not trust Facebook. I do not trust it at all !</strong><br>
**<br>
**<br>
As a consequence,  all the datas I put there can be public, I’ve no issue.<br>
No secrets.<br>
All my privacy settings are set to share everything, like this, I cannot be disappointed by Facebook if they change their mind.</p>
<p>I think everybody should do like me and this is why :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook is a very very young company</strong> that has grown very very fast.<br>
In these conditions, **errors are always possible</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 

  * **Facebook is inventing something totally new.**  
    Who could imagine this very big social network just 10 years ago ?  
    Who can predict what it will be in 5 years ?  
    The system is totally new, **the rules need to be written,** so for sure they will change. 
  * **Mark Zuckerberg has never been very keen to commit on user privacy.**  
    In fact it&amp;#8217;s the opposite.  
    Facebook commit to provide its users a system to share more and more datas with more and more people, by default, datas are shared.  
    **To build a system that is really sure in term of security and privacy it has to be designed for this since the beginning, it has to be part of it&amp;#8217;s DNA.** This is not the case for Facebook.&lt;/ol&gt; 

Of course not trusting Facebook limit a lot the added value&amp;#8230;  
Of course I hope that something new will come in future with less&amp;nbsp;functionalities, but with privacy commitment&amp;nbsp;written&amp;nbsp;in it&amp;#8217;s DNA.  
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;[Diaspora](http://joindiaspora.com/) ?
