<p>I’m a big fan of mindmapping, I use it quite systematically when I’m brainstorming, thinking, …</p>
<p>Today I’ve given a new try to <a class="zem_slink" title="Mind42" href="http://www.mind42.com/" rel="homepage">mind42</a>, and I have to say that I’m very happy of what I saw.</p>
<p>The team did a great work and the application is now very good.</p>
<p>What I prefer is :</p>
<p><strong>it’s simple</strong></p>
<p>In a simple browser, the application is very intuitive, no need to read long tutorial, …</p>
<p><strong>it’s bug free</strong></p>
<p>I did not try it extensively, but for basic usage, in a chrome browser, I did not meet any bug !</p>
<p><strong>it allows me to collaborate with others !</strong></p>
<p>This is for me a must have for mindmap application. Mindmapping is for brainstorming, puting your ideas on paper to sutrcure them but also to share them.</p>
<p>The best is to be able to collaborate on the same piece.</p>
<p>Today, I still miss the wonderful <a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-favorite-google-wave-gadget-is-mindmap-gadget/" title="My favorite Google Wave gadget is MindMap gadget">mindmap plugin</a> in google wave !</p>
<p>It seems that mind42 is very good for collaboration : 2 or more people can collaborate <strong>real-time</strong> on the same document. That’s great !</p>
<p><strong>it’s free !</strong></p>
