<p>I wrote a post &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-music-experience/">My music experience</a>&quot; in april this year, 6 motnhs ago.<br>
The purpose of this post was to give my personnal experience about music, from the 80s to these days.</p>
<p>My conclusion was that <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">spotify </a>would be a perfect system for me, with few enancements :</p>
<blockquote>to be able to "download" the music I like on some mp3 devices to be able to listen to them not connected to the internet.
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>to have a better management of my library (not just simple playlist).
> 
> </blockquote>
<blockquote>to imporve the social part of it : having my friend using it and sharing new songs / artists we discover
> 
> </blockquote>
<p>So what is the situation today ?<br>
Very simple, I'm now a premium spotify user, I pay 10€/month for that.<br>
I use spotify everyday to listen music : on my laptop when I work and I need to concentrate, in my car or at home on my stereo system, using the iphone.<br>
Why did I subscribe to the premuim ? 3 reasons :</p>
<ol>
<li>To get rid of the advertisment of the free version : In the free version, the advertisment message comes every 10/15 minutes, with the same message ! It's quite boring !  2. To use the Iphone application :  The Iphone application is great. The level of functionnalities is the same as the desktop version.  3. The most important feature is the &quot;offline mode&quot;.  In this mode, the applications download the music when you're connected to wifi, and after you can listen to it even if the Iphone is not connected to a network</li>
</ol>
<p>I've around 800 cds that I've paid at an average price of 15 Euros so a total of 1 200 Euros.<br>
This is equivalent to 10 years of spotify's premium subscription !</p>
<p>So today I'm a happy spotify premium user, I don't use anymore <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">itunes</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player">windows mediaplayer</a>, and I do not plan to buy any new CD or buy music online.</p>
<p>Of course, now, I hope that spotify will improve the experience with new functionnalities in the application (better playlist management) and social features.</p>
