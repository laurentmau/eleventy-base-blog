<p>Every day, I receive around 50-100 emails in my inbox.</p>
<p>Since years, I'm looking for a good method to stay organized, and not be overloaded by all these incoming pieces of information.</p>
<p>I think that I've found THE method that works (at least for me).</p>
<p>This method is a concrete implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting things done</a>, the method from <a href="http://davidco.com/">David Allen</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the few 3 steps to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>1 - Configure your email system</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I'm using Microsoft Outlook, but the setup can be done with every email system.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qPEVGvgxgu4/S0j3jJz3BsI/AAAAAAAAGUk/s9J9BKmHz8c/s1600-h/folders.GIF"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_qPEVGvgxgu4/S0j3jJz3BsI/AAAAAAAAGUk/s9J9BKmHz8c/s320/folders.GIF" alt="">
</a></p>
<p>I use 5 folders :</p>
<p><strong>0 - Inbox</strong>: where all email comes when I receive them</p>
<p>**1 - Action **: email for which an action from me is needed</p>
<p><strong>1 - Read / Review</strong> : emails that with stuff I need to read / review</p>
<p><strong>2 - Waiting for</strong> : emails for which I'm waiting for an action from someone else</p>
<p><strong>3 - Done</strong> : emails processed, kept for archive.</p>
<p>An extra folder &quot;<strong>Gmail view</strong>&quot; is there to get in outlook the nice looking &quot;conversation view&quot; of Gmail. You don't need it if you 're already in Gmail.</p>
<p>The numbers shown after the folder name are the number of items in the folder (not the unread items, I do not care anymore about read/ unread, you'll see why after).</p>
<p><strong>2 - Process your Inbox</strong></p>
<p>Everything starts with the inbox. When emails are received, they go there.</p>
<p>I process my inbox at least 2 times per day: on time in the morning, before lunch and another before leaving.</p>
<p>I avoid reading email as they come. I've noticed that if I read emails as they come, I lose what I'm currently doing, and jump from a topic to another, losing efficiency.</p>
<p>The inbox folder is sorted by &quot;from&quot; field.</p>
<p>The processing steps are the following :</p>
<p>a) open email and read it</p>
<p>b) if I can answer the email immediately (less than 2 minutes according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> standards), I do it, and I move the email to &quot;done&quot; folder</p>
<p>c) if I need to answer to the email, but cannot do it immediately, because the task needs more time to be achieved, I ask myself if someone in my team can do it for me</p>
<p>- if yes, I forward the email to him/her, I move the original email in &quot;done&quot; folder, I move the email sent in the &quot;waiting-for&quot; folder</p>
<ul>
<li>if no, I'll have to do it myself, I move the email to the &quot;Action&quot; folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>d) if I do not need to answer the email, but I need to read it more carefully (presentations, communications, ...), I move it to &quot;read/review folder&quot;</p>
<p>e) finally, if the email does not trigger any action, I move it to &quot;done&quot; folder.</p>
<p><strong>3 - Process &quot;action&quot;, &quot;read/review&quot; and &quot;waiting-for&quot; folders.</strong></p>
<p>Once a week I do a full, complete review of these folders during my GTD weekly review (every Friday 12:30 to 2 pm)</p>
<p>I review the &quot;waiting-for&quot; folder during the one-to-one meetings I've with my team members.</p>
<p>I process action and read/review when I've time (using GTD principles).</p>
<p>If I see that action and read/review folder are getting too full, I plan in my agenda for a specific session to review them.</p>
<p><strong>4 - Conclusion: Why I feel so good about this system?</strong></p>
<p>**
**</p>
<p><strong>a) the emails are sorted according to what I need to do with them.</strong></p>
<p>Previously, I tried to do it using &quot;read/unread&quot; and &quot;flags&quot;, but it wasn't efficient.</p>
<p>**
**</p>
<p>**b) all the emails I've processed are not anymore in my view. **</p>
<p>They are in &quot;done&quot; folder that I seldom open. I'm not disturbed by them.</p>
<p>**
**</p>
<p><strong>c) The KPIs to know if I'm under control or not are built-in.</strong></p>
<p>I just look at the number of items in each folder.</p>
<p>**
**</p>
<p><strong>d) coming to work in the morning with an email with few emails (just the one from the night, as I work with a 24x7 organization) is very healthy.</strong></p>
<p>**
**</p>
<p>I let you try it, and let me know what you think about it.</p>
