<p>My word for 2019 will be &quot;Enjoy&quot;</p>
<h4>I started with this &quot;word of the year&quot; idea 3 years ago.</h4>
<p>This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from <a href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj">Benoit Curdy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2016, my word of the year was &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/focus/">Focus</a>&quot;, which, for me, functioned as a reminder to spend more time on fewer things, avoid multitasking, be more present.</p>
<p>The next year I chose &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/learn">Learn</a>&quot; and spent more time on learning new things  related to digital like coding, big data, machine learning but also  lern things related to  the personal organization, to geopolitics, to history.</p>
<p>Finally, for 2018, I chose &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/read/">Read</a>&quot; with a target of  24 books to be read during the year (I finished at <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10834395">17</a>), doing some posts about the books (<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/books/">I did it for 2</a>).</p>
<h4>For this year, my word will simply be &quot;Enjoy&quot;.</h4>
<p>I'll try as much as I can to enjoy the moment, take time to appreciate a simple meal with my family, time to enjoy visiting a new city, time to enjoy running, looking at nature. To put it simple, enjoy more all small things that make my  life.</p>
<p>For this, I'll have to calm down, chill out, and also sometime take a step back from my busy schedule. I'll also have to improve the way I deal with notifications coming from all devices (more on that on a post coming).</p>
<p>I also plan to enjoy more at work.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love my job. I'm really passionate about it, tt's full of excitement, stimulations, great responsibilities, nice colleagues, ... but for this year I want to take time to realize how lucky I'm to hold such a position, to take time to celebrate our great results take time to really enjoy it.</p>
<p>&quot;Enjoy&quot; means also being optimistic. People keep telling me I'm not so bad at it, often I'm the guy that sees the &quot;half-full&quot; glass of water and this why the headline of my blog is &quot;Welcome, Smile, Life is good !&quot;.</p>
<p>Being optimistic is a strong engine for me and I'm convinced it helps to be to be stronger. Recently I've realized I'm sometimes less optimistic as I used to be especially in some stressful or boring situations.</p>
<p>I'll try to keep the positive view during this year!</p>
<h3>I wish you a very good year. Enjoy !</h3>
