<p>Yesterday (May 29th 2009)  I did attend SOLARCON in Singapore.</p>
<p>One afternoon of overlook of Solar energy business.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy">Solar </a>is about producing electricity using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics">PhotoVoltaic</a> (PV) technology.
After this afternoon, here are my ideas, my questions about this market:</p>
<pre><code>  * the market is very promising, a lot of nice charts that show a wonderful market in ... 2100
  * The ecosystem is not ready.
</code></pre>
<p>For example, for PV panels are done using silicon, historically, silicon market is shared by 8 big players. Today, 120 companies are ramping up in china. The forecast is to keep 20-30 players.
The prices went from 140$ / kg to 60 $/kg. No real idea of forecast.
* The grid parity (solar electricity at competitive price) should be reached in 2012 in area with high electricity coast / lot of sun like Italy and California.
* Current crisis has an impact on development : big investments are needed, and banks to not loan money these days.
* The technology is improving a lot, often, so investment done today may be obsolete soon
* Biggest countries (US, India, China) recently announced big plans to increase solar part in electricity production. Because they think green...and also because it's a good way to develop economy during the crisis.
To meet these targets of solar electricity production for 2030, the production of solar panel have to be 9 times bigger than what it is this year... for the next 20 years.. (sounds crazy, no ?)
* To sustain ecosystem, all players ask the  governments to give grants and to fix the electricity rates.</p>
<pre><code>  * Smartgrid is mandatory for efficient solar electricity production.
</code></pre>
<p>My feeling after these presentations is good, but a lot of very big investments have to be done, it will take time.
Politics help will be needed to sustain these very long term investments.</p>
<p>[Update 2012 : it seems twitter do not keep old tweets, the link below does not work anymore today]</p>
<p>During the presentations, I've updated my twitter using the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23solarcon+">#solarcon </a>tag (surprisingly, nobody else did this), so you can find my notes there.</p>
