<p>After 2 years sent in Singapore, I'm now based in France.<br>
I go to Singapore time to time for business.</p>
<p>Using twitter everyday, I realised that real time web is very linked to where you're, because of time zones.</p>
<p>When we use realtime web tools (twitter, search in twitter), the interaction is done with people online.</p>
<p>If you're online when other people are sleeping... the efficiency is not so high.</p>
<p>Being in Singapore, it was more difficult for me to interact with people in France, especally in evening time (evening in France is night in Singapore).</p>
<p>Internet is a very good tool to simplify interaction even if people are far away, for this, websites, emails are very efficient tools to share information, and exchange information, on asynchroneous mode.</p>
<p>With realtimeweb, it will change, it's more like having a log of interactions, but in realtime, so people need to use it at the same time to interact.</p>
<p>Everybody says, and we see it, that new web is about real-time, so it will be interisting to see how it will be auto organised, based on the location of people.</p>
