<p>1 year ago I decided that my word for 2016 would be &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/focus/">Focus</a>&quot; and I'm very happy about it.<br>
<img src="http://laurentmaumet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/robbie-300x300.jpg" alt="robbie"></p>
<p>This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from <a href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj">Benoit Curdy</a> and for 2016 it works for me. I really made progress, it helped me to be more efficient and enjoy life (1 tab in browser is quite challenging but I love it :-) )</p>
<p>It's now time to decide what will be my new word for 2017 and it will be &quot;<strong>Learn</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p>I've always been in a &quot;learning&quot; attitude. During my career, I've jumped between different topics, businesses, jobs.</p>
<p>Learning new things is key to be able to invent, innovate.</p>
<p>In the tech area, many things are happening: block-chain, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, autonomous cars, chatbots, platforms, and also Arduino, raspberry, IoT, ...<br>
The world is changing very fast thanks to new technologies and it's going faster and faster.</p>
<p>Looking back at what has happened in the last 10 years, is really mind-blowing.</p>

<p>What will happen in the next 10 years?</p>
<p>In order to really understand what is happening, be able to anticipate trends, and innovate I think it's even more important to learn.</p>
<p>My objective for this year will be to spend the time to learn new things, especially in the tech area.<br>
That will include</p>
<pre><code>  * learn more about A.I. I know the theory of neural networks as I studied it in the '90 but I need to learn how to use it now (could be with google Tensorflow or others)
  * learn new development languages (should be node.js and Angular.js)
  * learn how to assemble hardware to build simple automation in my house (could be [this](http://lifehacker.com/build-a-silent-texting-doorbell-with-an-amazon-dash-bu-1790899374) or [that](http://lifehacker.com/build-an-automated-voice-controlled-cat-feeder-1791033326))
  * learn more about block-chain (not sure what I can do with that).
</code></pre>
<p>In order to learn I'll have to :</p>
<pre><code>  * **Dedicate time** to this activity (this means less time other things, I'll have to make choices)
  * **Read** more and more: As Confucius said: “You cannot open a book without learning something.”. Last year I read [10 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/12898931?utm_source=twitter),  I plan to read at least 15 this year.
  * **Try things, experiment**. I'll try as much as possible to implement concrete things. Experiment means failure, and failure means learning.
  * **Share** as much as possible. Share with my friends, my colleagues, my family but also online. I'm a heavy user of Twitter and LinkedIn, I will be more present on Facebook to share and interact with others (especially to learn how it works )
</code></pre>
<p>I wish you a wonderful year!</p>
