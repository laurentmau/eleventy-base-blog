<p>Yesterday, I've heard about this new experiencing from the NASA on the moon.</p>
<blockquote>'  
A NASA spacecraft crashed into the Moon on Friday morning, on purpose, in a bid to discover ice hidden below the lunar surface.  
'</blockquote>
<p>I found this news quite strange : in order to find water, which is necessary for life... NASA crash a rocket. The symbol is not good !</p>
<p>I reminds me that same technical was used 50 years earlier on earth to discover world we do not know : the sea.</p>
<p>The french Commandant Cousteau used to put dynamite in the Mediterranean sea in order to count the dead fishes.<br>
It was when it was difficult to go under the sea (after he invented the open-circuit scuba that is still used today).<br>
At this point of time, using dynamite in the sea seems to be a good idea even for Cousteau that was a great defender of Nature (he fights a lot against dynamite fishing after).</p>
<p>I'm sure it's the same for the moon, and in 50 years our children will think &quot;But why did they send a rocket to find water ?&quot;</p>
