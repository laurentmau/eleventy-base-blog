<p>I'll not explain here why I think that google docs is a very good solution for business, I'll do it another day.<br>
I'll also not discussed the comparison of functionalities between Google docs and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft office</a> applications : today there's a gap, as even <a href="http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2009/11/according-to-google-google-docs-is-not.html">Google highlighted it</a>.</p>
<p>What I want to focus on is the 2 key improvements that need to be implemented before more companies can use it.<br>
2 functionalities that make the whole thing not usable in a business context.</p>
<p>If you propose users to switch to cloud applications, their 2 mains concerns are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Where are my datas ? How to be sure that nobody can access them ?  2. What happen if the network is down ? We cannot work anymore ?<br>
<strong>1- Security, confidentiality of datas.</strong><br>
For my personnal use, I do not really care about confidentiality of my datas. I do not share confidential stuff. If someone access it, I do not really care.<br>
For company datas it's totally different. Company datas are confidential : products, sales numbers, people names, ...</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, there's no real commitment of Google on this point.</p>
<p><a href="http://rookery5.aviary.com/storagev12/2851500/2851671_12a5_625x625.jpg"><img src="http://rookery5.aviary.com/storagev12/2851500/2851671_12a5_625x625.jpg" alt=""><br>
</a></p>
<p>This statement that can be found <a href="http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=37615">here </a>is really very vague.</p>
<blockquote>"Rest assured that your documents,  spreadsheet, and presentations will remain private unlless..."  
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure this commitment is not enough for a company to make the decision to switch to Google docs.</p>
<p><strong>2- Offline mode</strong><br>
Google docs uses &quot;gears&quot; to provide offline mode.</p>
<p>The functionalities provided are OK for email  : you can still access the mailbox, read, write emails that will be sent as soon as network comes back.<br>
Even on a poor network that is cut quite often, this is not an issue.</p>
<p>For the other applications, the story is different.<br>
With spreadsheet, you can only read the documents, but no changes are possible. This is a big issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://rookery5.aviary.com/storagev12/2851500/2851587_2b0f_625x625.jpg"><img src="http://rookery5.aviary.com/storagev12/2851500/2851587_2b0f_625x625.jpg" alt=""><br>
</a></p>
<p>In my opinion, especially for travelers, it's not acceptable to have such poor functionalities in offline mode.</p>
<p>According to some people, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">html5</a> that will be used in next releases of Google apps will solve it and offer a higher level of functionalities. We need it.</p>
