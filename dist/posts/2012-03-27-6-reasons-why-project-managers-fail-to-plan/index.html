<p>If you want your project to be successfull, you need to plan.</p>
<p>At the early stages, you need to plan the journey that will bring the team from the start line to the arrival (i.e. the end of the project).</p>
<p>Many projects fail because the team start to run without proper plan.</p>
<p>[h4]Everybody knows this, but why few people actually really plan before starting ?[/h4]</p>
<p>[h5]Because at the beginning, everything is possible.[/h5]Everybody is full of energy, the resources (manpower, time, money) seems to be infinite... So why plan ?</p>
<p>[h5]Because we are (often) too optimistics[/h5]
&quot;Let's go, it should be ok&quot;. Because at the beginning everything is possible, the mindset can be &quot;Everything is possible, se are good, so we Will succeed, so.... no need to plan !&quot;</p>
<p>[h5]Because planning is difficult. [/h5]</p>
<p>To plan you need to take a step back. You need to understand what is the essential. Planning requires specific skills.</p>
<p>[h5] Because planning means choices.[/h5]</p>
<p>When you plan, you need to choose the path, and to choose is to renounce. You need to decide wich path you'll not go. This is sometimes difficult.</p>
<p>[h5]Because planning seems boring. [/h5]</p>
<p>We all prefer action. We feel like &quot;loosing&quot; time planning when we could do so many concrete actions for the project !</p>
<p>[h5]Because we are too focused on concrete execution.[/h5]</p>
<p>They are so many things to do on the project : organise logisctics, welcome people, start first actions, ... From early morning to the night, the project manager is busy on very concrete actions with no time to plan...</p>
<p>[h4]So a good project manager will be able to forget these bad reasons that try to push him in the bad direction, and will focus on plan ![/h4]</p>
