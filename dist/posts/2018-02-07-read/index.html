<p>#My word for 2018 will be &quot;Read&quot;<img src="http://laurentmaumet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/34479911450_9ae0919cb6-300x200.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I started with this &quot;word of the year&quot; idea 2 years ago. This idea of replacing the traditional New Year’s resolutions by just 1 word is an idea I took from <a href="https://medium.com/@bcurdy/my-best-habit-the-word-of-the-year-db369dbc060d#.nxols5fsj">Benoit Curdy</a>.</p>
<p>In 2016 the word I choose was  &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/focus/">Focus</a>&quot;, in 2017 &quot;<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/learn">Learn</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>In fact, I realized that Focus + Learn = Read!</p>
<p>I love reading books as it's a quiet moment during which I'll have to focus on one single and simple task and at the same time it highly stimulates me, opens new horizons, brings me new ideas.</p>
<p>In 2016 I read 10 books, in 2017 16. For 2017, my objective is to finish 24 books which is 2 per month.</p>
<p>Around 1/3 of it should be fictional books that I listen to while running using <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a>.</p>
<p>The other 2/3 will be non-fictional books I'll read using my Kindle. For these, my objective will be to find a way to remind what I read.</p>
<p>When I read I often highlight interesting paragraphs or quotes. My track record in remembering what I read is very low, this is quite frustrating as one of my objectives when I read books is to learn things and to be able to share with others about these readings.</p>
<p>I'll implement the method proposed here  <a href="https://www.fs.blog/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/">A System for Remembering What You Read</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to be a little bit too complicated and may put many constraints on me but I'll give it a try and simplify it if needed.</p>
<p>I'll publish my notes about books on this blog even if it may be a difficult exercise as some of the books I read are written in French and here I write in English. But let's try!</p>
<p>I'll also continue to use <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/12898931-lmau?shelf=currently-reading">Goodreads</a>.</p>
