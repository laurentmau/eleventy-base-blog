<p>Today I just saw I've 1000 contacts on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin.</a></p>
<p>I use linkedin more and more everyday.<img src="http://laurentmaumet.com/france/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1000-contacts-LinkedIn-300x85.png" alt="1000 contacts- LinkedIn"></p>
<p>First it's my &quot;evolutive&quot; contact list : every time I meet someone I immediately send a connection invitation, and I don't keep anymore the paper business card.</p>
<p>If someone I meet is not on linkedin, I'll not keep his contact information.</p>
<p>I appreciate to keep &quot;light&quot; contact with people and follow their carreer and contact them again later even if they have a new job.</p>
<p>It's also a place where I share interesting articles (from feedly) and I read trending topics and also parse what my contacts are sharing, which is often good stuff as these people have something in common with me (they are in my network).</p>
<p>Until today my policy has been to accept all invitations (except very strange ones, but they are very few) and I'm quite happy with it as I don't feel totally overwhelmed by requests and I still see a coherence in my contacts.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll change that in the future.</p>
