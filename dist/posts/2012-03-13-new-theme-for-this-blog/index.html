<p>As you can see, I did several improvements on the blog.</p>
<p>First one is the theme.
Beginning of January I switched to very minimalist <a href="http://zenhabits.net/theme/">theme</a> proposed by Leo Babbauta.
I really loved it because it's clean and nice.
I've decided to switch to a new one because Leo theme is too minimalist for me.
It's not possible to insert widgets in the sidebar or footer for example.</p>
<p>It's also not possible to add comments.
Of course I could spend time to improve it and develop using php and css, but I'm not good enough, and don't have time for that and it's not a good idea, as Leo didn't implement these features on purpose.</p>
<p>Finally I've bought a theme : <a href="http://www.sleekdesign.pl/">Purity 1.0 by Tauris</a>.
It costed me 35 USD.
I choose it because it's minimalist, clean, but proposes all functionnalities from a standard wordpress theme.
I took me some time to switch to it as I had to &quot;redevelop&quot; pages.
I took me around 8 hours, which is a lot ! But finally I'm very happy by the result.</p>
<p>I hope you like it, do not hesitate to feedback to me and tell me if you'd like to see some improvements !</p>
