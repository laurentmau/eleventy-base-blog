<p>They are a lot of discussions these days around how Facebook handle it's user's data privacy.<br>
I've talked about it in a previous <a href="http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2010/05/nightmare-of-facebook-users-data.html">post</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, <strong>I've absolutely no issue with this</strong>.<br>
Do you know why ?<br>
Because <strong>I do not trust Facebook. I do not trust it at all !</strong><br>
**<br>
**<br>
As a consequence,  all the datas I put there can be public, I've no issue.<br>
No secrets.<br>
All my privacy settings are set to share everything, like this, I cannot be disappointed by Facebook if they change their mind.</p>
<p>I think everybody should do like me and this is why :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Facebook is a very very young company</strong> that has grown very very fast.<br>
In these conditions, **errors are always possible</li>
</ol>
<p>**  2. <strong>Facebook is inventing something totally new.</strong><br>
Who could imagine this very big social network just 10 years ago ?<br>
Who can predict what it will be in 5 years ?<br>
The system is totally new, <strong>the rules need to be written,</strong> so for sure they will change.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>**Mark Zuckerberg has never been very keen to commit on user privacy. **<br>
In fact it's the opposite.<br>
Facebook commit to provide its users a system to share more and more datas with more and more people, by default, datas are shared.<br>
**To build a system that is really sure in term of security and privacy it has to be designed for this since the beginning, it has to be part of it's DNA. **This is not the case for Facebook.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course not trusting Facebook limit a lot the added value...<br>
Of course I hope that something new will come in future with less functionalities, but with privacy commitment written in it's DNA.<br>
Maybe it's <a href="http://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora </a>?</p>
