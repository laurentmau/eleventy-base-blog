<p>I've a Samsung galaxy note since 3 weeks now.</p>
<p>I'll not do a full test here, as I'm not good for that, and as you can find many tests done by many very good people.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll give you the key reasons to have one.<br>
As a background, I've to say that I use or have used :</p>
<ul>
<li>Ipad 1 (personnal, at home)</li>
<li>Ipad 2 (daily for work)</li>
<li>Samsung galaxy tab (7 inches) (before I have the galaxy note)</li>
<li>few blackberrys (last one is a torch)</li>
<li>2 iphones (3 and 4) (used by my family members)</li>
</ul>
<p>So here are the reasons why I've replaced my blackberry and why I've given my Galaxy tab to my son :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>**I love the size. **<br>
The galaxy note is bigger than a &quot;normal&quot; smartphone and provides a really good reading experience.<br>
In the same time, it's not so big and fit in the pocket of my trousers (which is not the case with the galaxy tab 7 inches).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**I love the speed. **<br>
The speed is just amazing (going throw screens, launching applications, browsing internet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**I love Android Honeycomb. **<br>
The note comes with Android Honeycomb (Samsung commited to bring Android 4 -Ice Cream Sandwich  - in Q1).<br>
With this version of android, the user experience is really very good. It's now comparable with iOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**I love the weight. **<br>
The device is not heavier than my smaller blackberry!<br>
To acheive this, Samsung uses very thin materials (when you change the sim card, you're always affraid to breake it), but it's really good to have a light device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I love the integration with google services.</strong><br>
This is true for all Android devices, but the integration with Google services is really great. I love to watch my picasa photos. I love to find my preferred addresses in Google maps...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I love the battery life</strong>One of the problem on many devices is the battery life.
With the galaxy note, I can use it &quot;normally&quot; during the day without being affraid about having no more power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I love the screen resolution</strong>Screen is just amazing. Watching videos is a real pleasure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
