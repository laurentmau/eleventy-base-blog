</a></p>
<p>I discovered Leo Batauta Zen to done blog in January 2012.</p>
<p>I started to implement ZTD as my productivity method just few weeks after.</p>
<p>In order to help me during the first weeks and to share with the community,<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-lets-start/"> I started </a>a series of blog posts during the first weeks (<a href="http://laurentmaumet.com/english/my-experience-with-ztd-week-9-results/">in fact 9 weeks</a>).</p>
<p>The main changes in my personnal organisation since then are :</p>
<p><strong>Create a daily routine !</strong><br>
Take the habbit to create habbits and stick to them.<br>
This is a very powerfull skill that we all should learn ! Leo's approach is very pragmatic, concrete, and it works ! (at least for me...)<br>
For example , I've setup the habbit to run 3 times per week, the habbits to keep my email inbox at 0</p>
<p><strong>Every day, 3 MITs</strong><br>
Every single day I define the 3 (3, not 4 or 5!) MITs (Most Important Things) that I commit to do for this day.<br>
This is really a very simple but VERY powerfull habit.<br>
It helps me to feel under control and achieve most important things, so it's helps me to be more productive.</p>
<p>** Simplify, simplify, simplify**<br>
I'm an engineer, I like complicated and elaborated things. But based on Leo's advices, I'm now in a 'simplify' as much as possible approach.<br>
For example, my action management tool has been simplified drastically. I went from an elaborated GTD oriented system with maybe 150 actions into it in 20 different lists, to a simple system with 3 lists and around 30 actions into it.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm very happy about it.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a good productivity ;ethod, I highly recommend you to have a look at it.</p>
