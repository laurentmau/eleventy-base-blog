<p>In a post last October I asked my self if <a href="http://lmaublog.blogspot.com/2009/10/will-i-get-kindle-for-christmas.html">I should buy a kindle</a> for Christmas.</p>
<p>Finally, I did not and now I’m sure it was a good decision.<br>
I’ll never buy a kindle because I’ll buy an <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad" rel="wikipedia nofollow" title="IPad">iPad</a>, and I’ll use the kindle application to access <a class="zem_slink" href="http://amazon.com/" rel="homepage nofollow" title="Amazon">amazon books</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve already tried the kindle application for <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" rel="homepage nofollow" title="iPhone 3G">iPhone</a>.<br>
I’ve read a first real book on it and I was very impressed of the quality of the reading experience even on a very small screen : good contrast, very easy to read (even in bad luminosity conditions).</p>
<p>Having it on an Ipad (which is basically a big Iphone) will be just perfect for me.</p>
<p>I’ve just found an <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/06/ipad-consumer-behavior/">article in mashable</a>, where you’ll see that other people think like me.</p>
<p>So finally, Amazon will not sell a lot of kindle, but will sell a lot of electronic books, thanks to the kindle application.</p>
